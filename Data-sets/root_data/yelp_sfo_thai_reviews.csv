"Osha Thai	""|The food was pretty good", the environment nice, but the service was a little inattentive and the food was imbalanced.While good, our dishes had a LOT of one or two things;  mine had far too much bok choi and not enough of the mushrooms and tofu (the only two other ingredients.  The same was true for my companions -- too much onions and potatoes and not enough of the other ingredient or two.|Review is strictly for happy hour, which is in their bar/lounge area Monday to Friday, 5 - 9 pm.They have a decent selection of alcohol (beer, wine, and cocktails) on the happy hour menu as well as same Asian tapas dishes. I came here with a large group of coworkers, so we tried pretty much all the food.For my drink, I went with the pineapple millionaire ($17), which has Elyx vodka, St. Germain, pineapple tonic soda, passion fruit puree, fresh thai basil, and smoked chili. I know the price seems high but you get a huge serving that comes in a giant metallic pineapple cup, so I think it's worth it! It tasted like a fruity punch, and I could barely taste the alcohol. My type of drink!Food-wise, my favorites from the happy hour menu were the french fries ($6) and beef jerky ($9). They also offer dollar oysters, and we ordered plenty of those to share, but I think they were local oysters from Tomales Bay which I'm not a huge fan of. What I really liked was that it wasn't too crowded on a Friday afternoon. There were maybe 15 of us, and we had a hard time picking a place that would be able to accommodate all of us without a prior reservation. The lounge opens at 5, and since we arrived right then, they were able to quickly put together some tables and chairs for us. Plus most of the seating consists of couches and other comfortable chairs, so it gives it a more relaxed, homey atmosphere. Would definitely come back again for happy hour!|I love this place! Definitely one of my favourite thai in sf. My first order is pineapple millionaire and I get it everytime bc, why not? (Well, tbh I kinda have to.. lol) Food: I usually get their pad see yw with shrimp or in a pad thai, or pumpkin curry with tofu (pesci here)Oh, also, their sticky rice is pretty good too :)Everything I've tried so far have all been good! I like this location too; it's a nice place near the ferry building|Great Thai food walking distance from our hotel (le Meridien).  This place is an upscale restaurant with a lounge to the side of the restaurant. We ordered the chicken satay and pad see you.  The satay was done perfectly and was accompanied with toast which was different but worked.  The pad see you was the best I've had so far.  We also ordered the lychee martini which was perfectly made.|Nice ambiance. Get's pretty busy and loud. Came here for dinner about an hour before closing on a weeknight and even after closing hours they kept their doors open. Servers are attentive, water is always refilled. Fast service too. Food is comparable to their numerous locations in the city. Good for groups too.|Been here multiple times for the last 12 years since WAMU days. They do not disappoint when it comes to food, service and atmosphere. Their lavish decor and dining area are impeccable esp if you seat in by the lounge area in the back of the building. This is where the Happy Hour and also if durig lunchtime if fully-packed, they seat people on this side. We tried coming here once for their New Year's Eve party. The charge is $100 pp if you're interested in their full menu, includes appetizers and champagne for the New Year's Toast while watching the firework show just accross the street. This is private only for those guests who paid to get their tickets. They are located in front of the Ferry building so paying the $100 is not so bad. There's also an after party in the back, so dancing is the next event after watching the fireworks. Theres also a photo booth that you can enjoy. You can opt for $50 pp also but this only includes appetizers and champagne for toasting if you want. This still includes the pass to get in to the lounge after fireworks. Dont mind coming back again.|I eat at this place fairly frequently since it's right below my office, but I honestly have no clue how Osha Thai is still in business, much less successful enough to have four (five?) locations. The food is truly mediocre, and the prices would be too high even if the food wasn't so unremarkable.Yes," it's """"Thai food""""", but every dish is 50% sugar. I seriously wonder if the dessert and sweets stores near here are struggling with supply issues because Osha Thai has a stranglehold on all the sugar delivery. Diabetics, avoid this establishment.I'm being a little unfair - most Thai restaurants in most American cities share the same practice of catering to the American High-Fructose-Corn-Syrup-Addicted palate. I don't think it's unreasonable, though, to expect better of a Thai restaurant in SF, where probably something like 30% of the population is on keto (or at least in an on-and-off again relationship with keto like myself).Hey," at least this LA native can add another tally to """"evidence for LA's culinary superiority over SF"""". No self-respecting joint in Hollywood Thaitown would ever serve a plate of the sugary crud that passes for """"Thai food"""" at Osha.|I'm very late to the party", but I can now finally say that I dined at Osha Thai and I was very happy with the meal I had.  I do think my meal was more Asian Fusion rather than Thai inspired but was still very enjoyable.For appetizers, we started off the their Dungeness Crab Rangoon and Long Beach Prawns.Dungeness Crab Rangoon -- http://bit.ly/2HIqtNACrispy wonton filled with dungeness crab meat, cream cheese water chestnut, onion, carrot served with plum dippingLong Beach Prawns -- http://bit.ly/2HLG0vZCrispy coconut crushed tiger prawns served with onion, peanut carrot & iceberg slawBoth were pretty much standardized appetizers, cooked well, and had good portions for starters.  You can actually have one of these for a meal with side of rice.  The rangoons had a nice amount of crab and cream cheese filling inside and the prawns had a nice coconut crust.Then for my main, I went their Volcanic Beef (http://bit.ly/2HG4Ddz).Wok-fried grilled premium flank steak with basil and black pepper in lava sauce garnished with onion ringsI honestly decided on this because it caught my attention from their yelp picture gallery.  Visually very appetizing.  It was a bit much on the salty side, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.  I would order it again.I'm happy that I finally got a chance to try Osha.  It's little bit on the pricey side, but the quality of their food justifies the price.  I would love to come back again and it's a great spot to cater to large groups of friends or family.|Great Thai food that is aesthetically pleasing to the eye and delicious.  Conveniently located next to the Hyatt In the Embarcadero Shopping Center.   During a four day conference I went here twice.  First for lunch and the other for dinner.Romantic for dinner and super busy during lunch but the food came out quickly.5 Star:-Tender chicken breast Sate -Papaya salad with shrimp or fried tofu both are good but I prefer the tofu -one of the tastiest, sauciest and delicious Pad Thai - fried sweet banana egg roll with coconut ice cream was awesome Needs improvement:  (was not bad but could be better)-Pad see ew chicken, it wasn't bad but needed more flavor and wished they would of put Asian broccoli instead-spicy eggplant flavor was good but the dish was ruined since it was over cooked, we got super mushy eggplant-Mango sticky rice, fruit was still not ripe so it was sourGreat service, wonderful people and yes you are paying for the location.|Today we had gone with a huge group of 13 at the eleventh hour. They were very accommodating and, after a bit of wait," managed to seat us all together.I had the """"Osha Sea", a mixed seafood curry of calamari, shrimp, mussel, and salmon in a red spicy coconut sauce with eggplant. All the seafood were cooked just right, and the eggplant was almost perfect. It was soft throughout but held its shape and wasn't a collapsed mess. It was delicious and I went for a second helping of jasmine rice even.For a corkage fee of $20/bottle, which was pretty steep, they brought out wine glasses and served us our wine stash.All in all, it was a good group lunch experience.This lunch itself is a 4 star, but I'm averaging it with the previous sub-par lunch here.|Good food and quick service.  The higher than usual price is to be expected given its location.  The one ding is that on a packed evening it REALLY loud.  My friends and I were practically yelling at each other and I could barely hear them.  At a certain point it affects your ability to enjoy the food.|Great location for financial district workers or tourists/commuters needing to be near the ferry building (hence the steep prices).Nice, comfortable atmosphere. The service was... fine. The pineapple fried rice, spring rolls, and ginger mojito were fantastic. The spicy eggplant was mushy and kind of bland.I'd go back for sure.  A solid place, even better on someone else's dime.|I have been here quite a few times. The restaurant is quite fancy and nice looking. The food is affordable. The service is good. So here are some foods I've gotten in various occasions. Pad Thai was delicious and the presentation of the dish was beautiful.Pineapple fried rice was quite good as well, not super impressive though.Got this salmon which was delicious. Had raw oysters which were fresh and yummy.This place has a restaurant side and a lounge side. The lounge side is more of the nightlife kind of atmosphere with comfy couches. The bathrooms are very nice. This place is nice overall.|I've gone to the Embarcadero location a few times and every time I've enjoyed the meal. This spot gets packed due lunch hour so go early or late quick seating. It's a pretty big location and can be very noisy. I loved the Pad Thai.|Absolutely stunning food, pleasant staff, beautiful location, good for families  and groups, a little on the pricier side and portions smallish but this is a special occasion place, go have fun|Plating at this restaurant is very well done, but unfortunately the actual cooking does not live up to this standard. The decor and location are fantastic, but there are a lot of down sides. Service was slow, and for the quality of food it was definitely over priced. I was excited to try the crab pad thai, and unlike previous photos does not include any large chunks or claws. The crab pieces are very fragmented and I even found shell in mine. The sauce of the pad thai was overly sugary and more ketchupy than anything. The flavor was just not there," and the sauce wasn't balanced.. there was also zero spice. The papaya salad was a let down and only included three tiny shrimp that were supposedly """"grilled"""". The sauce was far too vinegary"," without any real flavor - it was definitely the worst dish of the night. I guess the """"best"""" dish was the fresh rice rolls", they were neat, but beyond the sweet sauce lacked any real substance and flavor. This appetizer came to $11.95 for basically some rolled rice sheets and sweet sauce.. totally overpriced. The worst offender for overpriced was the tea. Can you believe for $5 each they serve 10 cent bagged tea?! I was expecting so much more from a Thai place.. honestly I've never had such terrible tea at a Thai restaurant.. ever. Do NOT order the tea, save yourself the trouble and go to Starbucks or anywhere else instead. After we received all of the food at the table, our waitress never came back, no one asked how our meal was. When we finished our meal I had to go chase down the waitress to get the bill after waiting for nearly 30 minutes.|Excellent service.Ordered:Angel wingsSpring rollsPad se ew with chickenPanang currySweet sticky rice with mango.Everything was so delicious.  I really loved their Pad se ew.  I normally don't order with chicken, but it was really good.My other favorite was the sweet sticky rice with mango.  Amazing!|I've walked past Osha Thai dozens of times and never made it in...until now! You can only imagine how excited I was. Unfortunately, I ended up very disappointed.We started out with drinks, and everyone's was overwhelmingly sweet. From the ginger tea (which comes pre-sweetened) to the watermelon juice and Thai iced tea; everyone said their drinks were too sweet, so we ended up getting waters for the whole table and drinking only those.For appetizers, we had the mango salad with prawns and tuna tower, and they were okay.The entrees were bad went to worst. Several of us got their sea bass dishes, and the grilled sea bass was just awful; it was not grilled but soaked - and I mean SOAKED - in butter. You could squeeze it out of the filet. It was horrific. It made the entire dish unpalatable. Note to self: don't go to a Thai place and get anything other than curry. Lesson learned.Service also left much to be desired, but the food was just no bueno all-around. Bummer, because the ambiance is lovely.|I ordered Yellow Curry with Chicken ($14) and Coconut Rice ($2.50). The yellow curry was very sweet and salty. It was a little spicy and meaty. I was given a few pieces of potato slices, but they were very plain. I had a hard time understanding the waitress and thought she said regular rice was not included with the curry. Therefore, I ended up getting coconut rice (which I regret). It was also too sweet and did not match the rest of the curry. I ended up giving the coconut rice to another friend. I do not plan to come back. This place is waaay too expensive and the curry wasn't that great. Among the four of us," the total meal costed $115 and we did not order too many dishes. The best part of this place was the theming and cleanliness. The bathroom smelled like oranges!|Omg where do I begin...the service was great even during the FiDi lunch rush. I had the emporer noodles and it was nothing short of amazing. Will definitely be back.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lers Ros	""|Delicious! I highly highly recommend the:-Quail with sweet and spicy sauce",#NAME?,#NAME?,-Vegetarian Tom Yum soupYou won't be disappointed! Sorry no pictures. We ate everything :)|Dish: Shredded Papaya SaladCost: $13.95Rating: 3.75/5Review: Shredded green papaya salad with chili, tomatoes, peanuts, lime dressing and grilled prawns. I have to always remember that in Thai restaurants, mild is still spicy.  This dish was good, but I've had better. My lazy self wished the cabbage wasn't still in a wedge and shredded so I didn't have to mix it into the sauce and cut it. The sauce for the salad was good - your typically papaya salad mix. The prawns weren't memorable and of course wasn't much portion. It's good, but for the price I probably wouldn't order this dish here again since there's so many other better dishes this restaurant serves. Dish: Pad ThaiCost: $13.95Rating: 4/5Review: Pad Thai is probably my favorite Thai dish of all time so I usually order it everywhere I go :p It was good here but not my favorite. It's so pricey for a normal sized portion!There are 3 locations I believe but this review was from the Larkin Street one in the TL district. Parking can be scarce but not impossible! Located in a sketchy neighborhood so don't leave any valuables! You can make reservations here and I highly suggest making reservations! Came on a Friday night around 7:30pm and was seated in the middle in a communal table setting but there are 4 seaters on the side.|Came here for lunch after trying Kin Khao, which was a rather unique take on Thai food.Lers Ros does its dishes with authenticity and offers the basic Thai dishes you'd expect to find anywhere, but I found the flavours to be overly salty and not sufficiently sharp as a whole.That goes for the nam tok, nuer pad prik, and a gai pad phed.It's certainly not bad, but in my opinion, doesn't live up to the hype.|Cute, modern, and clean restaurant but unfortunately service was extremely sluggish. Took about 30 minutes for our food and the restaurant was pretty empty. Just hubby and I, and another  group of 3 that were already finishing up their lunch. So I couldn't understand why it took so long. We waited for about 15 minutes for our order of papaya salad, waited for another 10 minutes for hubby's pad thai, then another 10-15 minutes for my green curry. Sucks how all the food came out at different times. Over $50 for papaya salad, vegetarian pad thai, vegetarian green curry, and brown rice. Portion size was not worth it.Papaya salad: too saltyVegetarian pad thai: too sweetVegetarian green curry: too water down, no flavor. If you're looking for good authentic Thai/Lao food I suggest Champa Garden.|My friend and I decided to come here for lunch. The place is located in the Little Saigon area on the other side of the Tenderloin, and it wasn't too crowded when we went, but there was a big table. Because of that though, I felt service was a bit slow and we didn't get much attention until after the big table left.The food itself was okay, I had the two item combo and I got the green curry and the Pad Kra Pow Kai. The curry itself was pretty flavorful, but beyond that there wasn't really anything special about it, just standard of what you would get elsewhere. The ground chicken was just okay, it benefitted from adding a bit of lime and chili to it. One of the main drawbacks though is that they didn't provide me with the various chili, peppers etc. toppings that usually come with most Thai meals. Instead I had to ask for some of it on the side, and ended up just getting sliced fresh peppers (which were good, but not what I had expected).Otherwise an average Thai place, plenty of other great options in the city.|Such a good place for Thai food!Three recommendations that are outstanding. First, the Larb Phed Yang, which is a roasted duck with rice powder that gives it a nice crunch. It comes with a little like which goes great. Second, the Pad Kra Prow Moo Krob, which is Pork Belly that was perfectly crispy on the outside and super tender on the inside. Last, the Yum Pla Khem, which is  a salty crispy fish which was also delicious. The pepper bits in it can be a bit spicy though, so be warned.Service was also prompt and the staff were very kind and attentive. Prices may be slightly more than average for Thai food, but definitely worth the price. Would love to come back again and try more things!!!|As soon as I sat down, I knew I was gonna come back to this place.  The decor is cute and the service is attentive and friendly - we went at 11:30pm, close to their closing time. We got the basil chicken and yellow curry - pretty conservative choices because it was a late night dinner - both were very tasty. Every bit of the basil chicken was very flavorful and the texture went perfectly with the rice. The chicken in the curry probably could've been more tender. For dessert, we went with a pretty popular choice here: fried banana with strawberry ice-cream. It was very well done and not very messy to eat. The outside of the fried banana wasn't crunchy as I expected, it was a stretchy layer of coating with sesame seeds mixed in the flour - which, in addition to crushed nuts sprinkled on top, did make it pretty crunchy.|The two blocks stretch between O'Farrell and Eddie has six Thai restaurants to choose from so I decided to start with Lers Ros as it had 4 stars rating with over 2000 reviews. On a Friday evening it was packed to the brim with people waiting outside for a table. I was hesitant to get something but as I simply wanted something to-go I walked in and ordered.I decided to get the Kuay Tiew Rua ($11.95) which is just a fancy name for Thai Boat Noodle soup. After ordering I paid and then proceeded to wait outside. I waited and waited and then waited some more. Without exaggeration I waited about 40 minutes in the cold for a simple order of boat noodle soup. Each time I asked about the progress I was told it was it was almost done. Finally, when I asked for the order to be cancelled they gave me the soup. I good news is that I got 2 containers one with the noodles and the other with the broth which keeps the noodles from becoming soggy. The bad news is that the broth lacked seasoning. It had a ton of spices as I had asked for spicy but they seemed to be simply added to the broth rather than being properly cooked with it. Another issue was that the quantity of noodles in the order was very little and were all clumped together. Goes without saying I did not like what I got. Price-wise this was about 20% more than the same dish in Pak Nam Thai noodle bar and 10% less than Lapats Thai Noodle Bar both of which are just a block down the road. Unfortunately, the quality is nowhere even close to what you can get at the other two places. I had high hopes for Lers Ros given its high ratings but I was thoroughly disappointed with my visit. With so many options in its vicinity I doubt that I will return.|Still one of the best Thai out there! tried few new ones here and there...always comes back to Lers Ros at this location. you won't be disappointed.|Nah. Overhyped. Way overhyped. Tonight was my fourth visit here within six months. Last two visits were with larger groups," so I definitely had a chance twice to try a large variety of their dishes. I feel I'm """"supposed""""to like it", because of all the hype and restaurant-generated pr that they definitely excel at. Every single time, though, I left wondering if it was me who ordered the wrong dishes, or if I was just missing something. It wasn't me. This place knows how to pump up the pr, but little else. Food - Many dishes were pretty salty, like the frog and their red curry dishes. Eel was cut into super tiny pieces and were small and bony to get any meat off the eels. Fail. Other places have way more meaty slices. Total waste. roast duck was mostly a soggy glob of fat. Tried both the chicken and pork pad see yuck (yes, I mean yuck). Strange, the pork one was super salty and the chicken one was bland, but both had mushy flat noodles. These rice noodles can be difficult to cook, especially if they're not super fresh. I suspect the latter is true.  Clearly, not much effort is made into presentation either, as many of their dishes were accompanied with the same sliced cucumbers, tomatoes and cilantro garnish. DIshes I did like were the deep fried tofu and the deep fried crab ball-like appetizer.Service was certainly no stand out. Seems that you need to ask for any and all water refills. Our waitress was polite, but really wasn't able to sufficiently address questions I had about some dishes I was contemplating between. I sensed a language barrier, on her part.Nothing special at all about the ambiance inside, but...TOURISTS BEWARE:Now the ambiance outside, well, anyone coming here needs to know it's really a sketchy hood that has gotten even worst in recent years. If you don't mind walking by people who are shooting up, drugged out, drunk, in need of serious mental health services, or are asleep on the ground propped up against the wall, then you should be fine. And you need to be ok with the more than normal San Francisco stench of urine all over. If that's hip for you, go at it. Not for me. The food, service and atmosphere is so not worth that! And of course, don't forget the higher than normal rate of car break-ins here in the Tenderloin. Knowing all this in advance, I Ubered here.Gave it more than a fair chance. Way to many better options in the Foodie Bay Area . No return visit here!!|Really cool decor in a modern setting. For me food was only so so! Place is in a shady area but it's ok. Service was ok but a little bit of attitude from some. The crispy pork belly was extremely average and too salty. The Nuer Yang - beef with lime juice was also too salty and tasted like lime juice from a squeezy bottle not fresh. On the whole I think it was overpriced and caters to the tourists more than the authenticity of being a Northern Thai restaurant.|Favorite Thai food in the city. Must Tries:Crab fried rice.Crispy chicken with ginger rice.Sparerib appetizer.|Our waiter, Jeremy, seriously is the coolest dude I've ever met.  So friendly and attentive and very helpful about what items to order on the menu.  He made this experience such an enjoyable one.  He made sure that our entire dining experience was perfect, that the food was tasty and cooked to perfection and made us just as happy as possible.  I would come back JUST to have him serve us again.  We came here on a Sunday around 1:00pm for lunch.  There was not many people at all, very slow Sunday afternoon.  Be mindful of the area you have to walk through to get to this amazing restaurant.  The Tenderloin is pretty rough and I don't recommend anyone walks through here at night time and if you do have to, make sure you have somebody to accompany you. We ordered many different foods of which all were delicious.1. Pad See Ew (w/pork): the noodles were rich and tender.  Very enjoyable, it is hard to finish this entire meal though... I tried to stuff myself and regretted it later. 2. Thai Curry Puffs: GET THESE.  They are amazing and so soft, sweet, savory, and crispy all at the same time.  YUM!3. Chicken Satay: pretty good.  Just some average tasting chicken on a stick (lol) but tasty nevertheless.4. Red Curry dish: A friend ordered this and said it was the best curry he's ever eaten.  (he even later went to a different thai restaurant to compare he two red curries and mentioned later that Lers Ros tasted wayyy better ;) )5. Moo Preaw Warn: a sweet and sour pork dish.  Tasty and sweet.  6. Mango Sticky Rice:  So much sauce and such perfect texture.  The mango was so ripe and juicy and this was honestly just the best part of the meal. ( so sad I was stuffed already to be able to enjoy this desert to the fullest extent) BUT I'm glad we tried it.  It's very good.If you want good, authentic thai food Lers Ros takes much pride on their food.  I definitely will be back because my first experience here was 5/5 (:|This place was busy! We had a reservation but got there early and they sat us right away. We got the shrimp papaya salad that was delicious and fresh. We got the coconut shrimp soup and that was good and nice to have it on a warmer. We ate the tilapia and that was super spicy I couldn't eat it. We got the seafood pad see yew and they accommodated my friend by using a soy sauce alternative. The squid in it was super chewy. They spoon out the rice for you and it's really weird so it makes you think that's all you get and they will take it away. We finished the meal with durian and mango sticky rice desserts. The durian was mild. The mango was nice and ripe.|Third time here. Food is overly seasoned (too salty) and excessive use of raw onions and raw cabbage turned me off.Also concerned about lack of Asian diners, which could mean nothing in a city of discerning consumers of every stripe.I don't think the high prices and the bad neighborhood make the effort to return here worthwhile.Service is fine. Food comes out at a good pace.|Soooo yummy!! There are quite a few Thai options around tenderloin area, but this one rly takes the cake for me. Slightly pricey, but they have great lunch specials. One page allows you to select 2 entree combos vs just 1. I was gonna order the tom kha soup on a cold day, but I saw seafood and curry together and was sold. This was on the 1st lunch special page where you can only pick 1 entree. See my picture. Comes with salad and rice, which you can opt for brown if you ask. The curry didn't look like much, but the flavor was so on point!!! So good, only wish I had more. The salad dressing is also light but yummy. all the ingredients were fresh and the restaurant is clean and well maintained.I found this place on yelp and suggested it to our team for a work holiday outing (my manager is the best!) And our entire party of 8 loved their food.They allow reservations, though they don't get too crowded til around 1pm. Beware when calling, the Thai accent is quite thick!I will definitely be returning !  Their menu is intense, 100+ items. They also serve up specialty exotic meats, like alligator, venison, quail, boar, frog... and of course vegetarian options too.  The options are endless ;)|Lers Ros is a lovely little Thai place with lots of options.FOOD:+ Koh Moo Yang ($12.95): Grilled slices of pork shoulder served with chili and rice powder sauce. If you have to get anything from Lers Ros, GET THIS. This is so so so good! The pork is flavored really well and very tender, and the sauce just makes it that much better. + Pad Thai ($12.95): On the menu, this automatically comes with prawns. I don't know if there's an option to substitute the prawns for another type of protein, but I was ok with prawns. Yes, I know. How uncreative of us-- going to a Thai place and ordering Pad Thai. But in our defense, we wanted to order the Pad Thai because it's something that all Thai places typically serve and we wanted a benchmark dish to compare to other places. This may have been a mistake, as I thought the Pad Thai was only so-so here. It wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't the best that I've ever had. + Kang Karee (Yellow Curry) ($13.95 with rice place, a la carte $14.95): Another staple dish. This was pretty tasty, though pretty expensive for the amount that we got.If I'm being honest with myself, for the food that we ordered, this is probably more of a 3.5 for me when I take into account taste and price, but maybe we didn't order the right dishes? The Koh Moo Yang was amazing, so I give props for that.tl;dr: Location is not the greatest, but I would come here again to try some other dishes. Would definitely get the Koh Moo Yang again!|Such a fresh papaya salad n brown rice. One of the best spots open up late. After hours, Shrimp was so fresh as well.|We came with a medium sized group and ordered a variety of things, and were pretty happy with everything that came our way.I had a crispy chicken served on a bed of garlic and ginger rice.Also would recommend any of the noodle dishes, and also a Thai puff pastry appetizer.|All really good, legit Thai food but...SUPER SPICY!! All of us had our mouths on fire haha. My favorites were the special fish, pad see ew (I've had this plenty of times elsewhere but here it was bomb), and the crispy pork. Yum!! I'd say those are the must get items imo. The soups were also delicious, Tom Kha (spicy, mix with rice!) and Tom Kha Gai (coconut Thai chicken soup). Nice that they dimmed the lights and played happy bday for our friend. Docking a star for not being seated until 40 minutes after our reservation on a Saturday night. Otherwise," delicious Thai food :)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"King Of Thai Noodle House	""|Look.  It's SF and you're in Union Square.  You want something fast and moderately priced?  You want take out?  You want Thai noodles or some delicious soup?  King of Thai is your place.  There's also some delicious garlic chicken wings on the menu.  One order of that some white rice and I was set.  Oh yeah I got 12 wings in one order.|My boyfriend and I were strolling the streets of SF when we step upon this little Thai restaurant. Restaurant was pretty roomy compared to most restaurants nearby and it was full of staff running around to cater to the customers. There's a bar table area and multiple tables. We were instantly seated as there were tables ready. We ordered pad thai and the pineapple fried rice under the chef's special menu. The pad thai was more on the saucier side but wasn't as good as Thai Lover's pad thai from San Jose which is one if my go-to Thai restaurants. If you wanted something more authentic", I wouldn't recommend coming here. As for the pineapple fried rice, I would just skip out on this dish next time. It was close to flavorless and there weren't that many chicken pieces. On the bright side, our food came pretty quick. Not sure if this is a fusion restaurant, but the menu included many chinese dishes. Food was mediocre, staff was nice. Probably won't be coming back.|Love-hate restaurant. King of Thai used to be a pretty cheap and enjoyable restaurant that serves your everyday Thai cuisine, but definitely has fallen in taste over the years. It's a great place for a quick Thai food fix, but other than that, nothing too memorable. On this particular experience, we ordered Pad Sew Ew (w/ shrimp) and Pad Thai for delivery. Pad Thai was pretty plain in taste and Pad Sew Ew tasted super burnt and dry. No type of flavoring or sauce whatsoever! Don't recommend! You can go to other downtown Thai restaurants that are way better.|Came in Thursday evening ... pretty busy but quick turn around service .. also tons of menu options.. I asked the server for a recommendation and he said the number 4. So YES. Order the combo beef noodle soup. PHENOMENAL ..amazing noodle soup, delicious broth and large portion... almost sharable if you're not too hungry. I was starving so i devoured it! Quick, in and out spot. Soooo good, highly recommend.|King of Thai Noodle isn't much of a king. Not authentic! I had the beef noodle soup," usually called """"boat noodle"""" (#1 on their menu). I suppose that should be what I expected - beef noodles and not the authentic Thai flavors I'm use to. It tasted like a fusion of pho and boat noodle. It didn't taste bad and the service wasn't terrible like the other reviews warned.Overall", I'm definitely okay with the experience. The price was a little high ($13, compared to $8-$9 at other restaurants for the same thing). A little more noodle than other places, but wouldn't recommend unless I'm in a pinch.|I'm actually giving this place 3.5 stars.We came here one time as we wanted to grab a quick lunch before we do what we're supposed to do for the day and it served us well. Prices were decent and portions were pretty generous.I ordered yellow curry with beef while my bf ordered chicken breast over fried rice. Both were good. I didn't, however, like the consistency of the yellow curry as it was watery. It was still tasty though. My order came with papaya salad and that too was delicious.Customer service was good. They brought our food out very quickly and the staff were also friendly. They hovered around though while we ate so that was pretty uncomfortable. Location is pretty convenient as it's adjacent to Union Square/Macy's. Ambiance is loud as it gets pretty busy during the day and the place can feel tight. I do, however, like the wall art of San Francisco and Bay Area teams on their wall so make sure to check that out.King of Thai Noodle House is one of my boyfriend's favorite hole in the wall in the city and with the decent experience we had during our last visit and despite the 3.5 stars only, I wouldn't mind coming back here for a quick Thai food goodness.|I have a love hate relationship with King of Thai.  I love it because they carry my favorite soup, but I hate it cause its sooo overpriced and I have a hard time finding it in the city.  Darn you supply and demand.Pork noodle soup- fav with the thick noodsPapaya salad- no complaintsThe rest of the menu looks promising, but I don't steer away from my go to meals.  The restaurant always looks busy, but there's never too long of a wait.  Service is quick.|I was somewhat hesitant to eat here, considering some of the reviews raised some red flags. But after having a late lunch here with a couple folks, I'll definitely come back.Service was fast and friendly. The staff were also accommodating of my stroller.What we ordered:- Chicken panang curry: There was more than I expected, and the meal came with white rice. The flavor was good, although I wished it had been spicier.- Fried chicken with rice: Came as expected. - Chicken with green beans: Requested extra spicy and got it!- Beef jerky appetizer: Deliciously seasoned, and the dip provided also had good flavor- Red wine: As expected- Thai iced tea: Great flavor, and the perfect amount. Some restaurants add a lot of ice, resulting in not a lot of tea, but it was just the right mix here.I would definitely come back and try more items on the menu! I'm looking forward to the spicy beef noodle soup :)|Great place to eat after watching a Musical!! Open late and the clear broth soup is better than the Beef broth ones.  Our whole group agreed but that's our opinion. Otherwise the soup is very flavorful and good serving size, perfect for cold nights.  Thai Ice Tea was delicious. Fast service.|Horrible Thai food! Not sure if the cooks know what Thai food is. I would give it 0 stars if I could!The tomyum soup has no spices at all and tastes like chili flavored water. For $12, it has measly slices of rock hard chicken slices and dried mushroomThe pad Thai is edibleDo yourselves a favor and avoid this joint|The place has constant traffic. People never stop coming in. We sat down at around 9:15 pm and people were coming in in droves. The Thai food came quite rapidly and was rather tasty. If you have a craving for Thai near Union Square, this is the place.|The place to be if you don't care about service quality and just want to get some fast Asian food. My go-to's here are the hoi jor, pad Thai, kao gra prow, or the crab fried rice. I used to enjoy the salmon curry until they gave me an order with bones in the fish.|Is there anything lower than one star? I ordered from UberEats. There was A LONG BLACK HAIR in the pineapple rice. It wasnt even on top, it was weaved in the middle!! I have blonde hair and my boyfriends is short black. I was so disgusted and disappointed. Never buying food from there.|Open until 3am that cured our drunken Thai food search last night - so glad we found this place! $13 for each soup, #4 combo beef noodle soup (broth is amazing) and the seafood noodle soup. We both got flat rice noodles. The papaya salad is great and the spicy went well with our soups. (They'll warn you it's really spicy haha) I like that they have a jar of peanuts on the side with other condiments. The service is fast and efficient, the food is satisfying and big portions. I would skip the $3.95 Thai iced tea though!|This is my absolute favorite place to get Roasted Duck Noodle Soup--- the soup is light but very flavorful. I ran into here by chance after waiting awhile at a restaurant nearby. We weren't expecting much so when we had a bite of their recommended duck noodles, we were truly taken aback. Highly recommend coming here for their noodle soup dishes in combination with the delicious crunchy complementary side jalapenos and peanuts on the table.|TL;DR perfect if you want Thai food in DT SF I love getting the Pad Thai at King of Thai. It's the same every time, hits the spot, even though it's not the best. They have everything a Pad Thai should have, but there is no wow factor. This KoT is located in DT SF, perfect for a lunch or dinner break from shopping or work. The prices at this KoT is way higher than other Kots. The space is huge, and they can even combine their tables for a large party.|This was a place my mom and I went to in search of a place that could serve us right away as we were both hungry. It's a busy place but the service was fast and we were seated and served food right away. We ordered a delicious fried rice and pad see ew, which was both enough for the two of us. The waitress always checked up and refilled the water we needed, and the prices were on the high side but the food was worth it.|Says open till 2am.  Ubered out here at 1am.  Closing up.   Asked them about their hours, got very rude responses.|Didn't know what to eat in Chrismas day so a friend recommended me here.Got here about 2 pm and pretty busy but we didn't wait too long for seats. I ordered Pad See Ew with chicken. It was a bit too sweet for me. The chicken tasted like overcooked.Service was quite quick.Price for dishes is $12-13 each. Overall, expensive cost for the Pad See Ew with quality like this. Would try other Thai restaurants in town.|I would say this place is a 3.5 star restaurant, but gave it a bump since they close after midnight. It's a place where I would be OK to eat at when I'm in the mood for Thai food, but not good enough for the constant crave. I ordered the Guay Tiaw Lord noodle dish and thought it tasted pretty average. I felt that the dish was one big blob of gravy and everything else was just swimming in it. Also," the portion size wasn't exactly the most beneficial when tax and tip put the dish at around $18 dollars. I just felt like something was lacking throughout the whole meal.I've had their Crab fried rice in the past and thought that tasted really good. So perhaps my most recent visit was just an off day. Hopefully that's the case.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Marnee Thai	""|I went here with my best friend for dinner. We got the spicy angel wings", yellow curry, and chicken satay. The chicken satay was very flavorful and had a savory curry-like flavor. We also ordered the angel wings and that was our favorite appetizer we ordered. The angel wings are slightly sweet and not too spicy. The yellow curry for our entree we got was also very good and not too watered down unlike some other Thai restaurants I've been to. The only con I'd have for this restaurant is that it feels a little pricy compared to other Thai restaurants, but it's still my favorite place.|EVENT: you go for a run around golden gate park... and you're feeling... hangryz! It's that time.... time to eat...you know itFOOD: my two favs to order at a Thai place(1) Papaya Salad: delish! And very comforting! Very light and good!(2) Pad See Ew with Beef: sweet and delish! Perfectly made!**OVERALL: if you need a good and delish Thai Place! Come here! Fast and quick service too!|Food was decent. Got the yellow curry but it was lukewarm. Brown rice was really hard and stiff that I ordered an extra white rice. Pad Kee Mao was okay. We wanted it to be spicy but it was kind of mild. The noodles were well cooked though.|IF IT'S ONE THING YOU DO, ORDER THE CHAN PAD POO.I've already written a review for the other location in the Inner Sunset, but this location deserves some love too. I actually prefer this location to the other because it's bigger and I enjoy the staff here!The food is authentic and amazing. I've never ordered something I didn't enjoy, and if I could come here every day, I would. Someone please make my dreams come true.FAVORITES:Appetizer- Homemade Hot Cakes: YUM! These are grilled rice coconut cakes served fresh off the griddle with coconut cream, fresh corn, green onions, and pumpkin. Sounds like an interesting mix because it is, but IT WORKS and is so so good.Salad- Green Papaya Salad (Som Tum): a perfect example of something so simple, yet so good. Soup- Tom Yum: a spicy and sour soup that just soothes your soul, really.Noodle:- Chan Pad Poo: MY #1. This is essentially a crab pad thai, but better. It's a spicy rice noodle dish with stir-fried crab meat and egg in a chili garlic sauce. I'm currently drooling writing about it. I COULD LIVE OFF THIS STUFF.Curry:- Mussamun Chicken Curry: a southern Thai style curry with chicken and potatoes in coconut milk, but really, all the curries are bomb.From the wok:- Pad Kaprow: your choice of meat (I prefer chicken) sauteed with fresh chili, garlic, bell pepper, and Thai basil. THIS THE ONE.Dessert:I've tried all of them, and they're all good (surprise), but my top 3 would be:- Banana & Black Bean Sticky Rice with Coconut Ice Cream- Mango with Sticky Rice- Roti with Coconut Ice CreamMarnee Thai delivers, every time. It deserves 10 stars.|Whenever we go Thai, we go to Marnee on either Irving or 9th.  Both have been at their locations for a long," long time.  Easier to find parking at the smaller Irving Street location than the 9th Avenue location.  The Irving Street establishment can get cramped and you'll likely have to wait for a table. """"May"""" - the Lady of the House", is LOUD and KIND.  She'll greet you like an old friend but will be blunt with you and tell you she can't sit you til everyone is there.  She'll sing you a Happy B-Day, lights off with the entire restaurant if you're good!  She really is nice... get to know her.Chowed down on:- Satay Chicken Appetizer which comes with Butter Lettuce, Bean Sprouts, Cilantro, Dried Coconut," and a Sweet Peanut Butter based sauce.  Good """"Date"""" dish as it is very hands on wrapping the chicken with lettuce and putting on the toppings...- Pork Belly which can get spicy"," eat this with Brown Rice- Coconut Tamarind Shrimp and Chicken Noodles which was good but our least favorite- Sticky Rice with Mango for Dessert- Thai Iced Coffees and TeaSounds like a lot?  We definitely """"Chowed"""" down and took home half the noodles.  Good service in this tiny place...|The stellar standout was the mango sticky rice with the black rice", specifically.  I've never had the black rice prepared like this, and it was done very well - not over cooked, but nicely al dente, which provided a perfect contrast to the soft fleshy sweet mango.  It truly was fabulous, and reason alone for me to return, but probably the only reason.  Marnee Thai was really a hot restaurant years ago, as exemplified by the wealth of accolades noted on the left side of their menu.  They were one of the early few Thai restaurants around, long before the ethnic food craze began.   However, I think the latest award was received back in 2011 or some time there about.  Unfortunately, the restaurant setting itself is also stuck in a time warp.  Other dishes we ordered were the green curry (with chicken and additional tofu for $3.00), along with the pad see ew.  Both were fine, but not particularly exceptional in any way.  The noodles of the pad see ew were broken up more than I would've preferred, which makes we wonder how fresh the noodles were to begin with.  If they're super fresh, they don't normally break into such smaller pieces, unless they've been refrigerated.  There were other dishes I saw other people ordering that looked more appealing to me than the ones we ordered, so perhaps it was our bad for not knowing what dishes to get.    Service left a lot to be desired.  We had to ask a couple of times for the rice we ordered, when the other dishes were already served and getting cold.  It wouldn't be proper to have a curry dish without rice, right?We've had really superb Thai food in Thailand, so I know how excellent Thai food can really be.  This isn't it. I know... we're not in Thailand either.  Fairly priced meal though.  Lastly, it has been about about 7 hours now since we dined there, and I've been finding myself really thirsty in the last few hours, an after effect that I really don't like.  Just stick with the mango black sticky rice.  No pun intended.|Solid Thai spotWhat I've Tried:*Pad see ew -so good here*Pad Thai - good good*Tom yum noodle soup - yum*Angel Wings - good for sharingOverall thoughts:*The first time I came here. I tried the pad see ew and was blown away. The flavors were so different in a good way. There was sweetness in the dish without that artificial taste or feeling like a bunch of sugary sauces were added. (Another time we came here our pad see ew tasted like garlic noodles which threw us off. It was as if they forgot to put some sauces in but we never experienced that problem again when we ordered other times.)*Service is a little strange here. They get really busy and don't usually have time to check on you which is fine with me but if you need something you'll need to flag a waitress down. One time I wanted a pad see ew with beef and my bf wanted a pad see ew with chicken and she said how bout both chicken cuz it's easier to make. Kind of weird but I also understand since they're busy. Also coming from a very Chinese background, I can relate with employees that try to get things their way. Regardless, food is enough for me to come back. *Portions are pretty big and prices are decent too.|Overall excellent food.Thai iced tea -- 5/5Had a good balance of sweetness and tea flavor. No complaints!Summer roll -- 4/5Basically a Vietnamese spring roll with a peanutty sauce. The waitress recommended this special menu item for its freshness, which I agree with. Nothing special but I thought it was still good. Next time I want to try their usual egg rolls. Pad thai with chicken -- 5/5Excellent execution on a classic dish. The noodles were the right consistency (soft without being mushy) and the sauce had the perfect amount of tang and sweetness. Pad see woo with chicken -- 5/5To be honest, I was a bit hungover (lol) or else I would have gone for something spicy, but I was still more than satisfied with my dish. Very flavorful, fresh, what pad see ew should be. Note that Marnee Thai's version used regular broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli, which was a slight copout, but didn't detract from the flavors.I'll say that the entrees were all a tad more garlic-y than typical Thai, but I'm not mad about it at all.|I ordered Pad Thai to go and it was soooo good! Even though I had it 2 hours later, it still tasted fresh without becoming soggy from the trapped heat. Their to go portions are also larger than most restaurants, but it did cost ~$14.50. It's pretty hard to mess up Pad Thai, and it's even harder to make your Pad Thai stand out from other restaurants...but Marnee Thai did it! Something about it just made me know that this will be my go-to spot from now on. I'd definitely come back again!|In short, FOOD was amazing!!  Service wasn't the greatest... but I'll take great food over great service ANY DAY.  In this case, chalk it up to cultural differences, nothing major.  Ordering was a challenge because she seemed preocupied & kept glancing around at other tables.  I wasn't confident she was even listening & she didn't write anything down.  She appeared to be in a huge hurry, haha, twice she tried to walk away before we finished ordering.  However, our food came out in a timely manner with no missing items, waters got refilled, they have a restroom & it was decently clean, they nicely boxed up leftovers, and paying the tab was simple.  I'd go back if I find myself in the area again.|Marnee Thai is my go-to spot for Thai food in the city. Friendly service, tasty food and reasonable prices.I recommend ordering the Tea Leaf Salad & Pad krawpow Gai. The tea leaf salad is a mixture of nuts, greens and seeds tossed in fermented tea leaf. Hard to describe but it's a refreshing and earthy flavor. The seeds and nuts compliment the dressing and flavor very well. The pad krawpow is the basil chicken which you can also order as pork. This dish is my favorite and tastes amazing! The meat is juicy and flavorful. Perfect with a bowl of rice. It was so good that we ordered a second dish to go for our lunch the next day. I also enjoy the standard dishes - pad thai, Pad see ew and Green curry. The place delivers quality food. Notes: -Cool ambience with the hut style roof-Lots of metered parking -Easy parking after 6pm-Very little wait space inside so be prepared to wait outside in the cold|So they say this place is a Michelin Star restaurant. Honestly, it was not as amazing as I expected. We got the pad Thai and this eggplant dish. The eggplant didn't taste very fresh. The pad Thai was pretty good, but not amazing. The food was still good though, just not amazing. There is a tiny bathroom here.Their online ordering tablet was malfunctioning that day. There was this guy working for a delivery service coming to pickup food. He didn't know much English. The employee asked me to translate Chinese for him but he wasn't even chinese. He was Korean. I felt bad for the delivery guy because the tablet was malfunctioning so he couldn't get the food. The employees were frustrated because they made this food and no one came to pick it up.|You will find authentic Thai cuisine here. They use strong spices and flavoring in their food, which is absolutely fantastic. I tried the som tum and tom kha gai and they were both amazing. You'll be in for an explosion of Thai seasoning and flavors in your mouth. I'd say order a side of white rice because the dishes are extremely flavorful.The two dishes I tried were also extremely sour, so watch out if you can't take sour foods. I use lots of lime/lemon in many of my foods, so I definitely enjoy the sour taste. With that being said, even these dishes felt a bit more sour than I could handle without some other starch on less sour dish on the side. But I do enjoy the taste so. I unfortunately did not order any rice the day I went, but definitely would next time I come here. And you can bet I will come back.One thing I'd want for the dishes is for them to be more spicy or have the option for us to order levels of spiciness. There was barely any spiciness to the dishes I had. At least a chili pepper on the side so I can chow on would be great.The interior is quite cute; it's like you're inside some Thailand hut. I don't like the lighting, though. It's extremely dim, which makes the place seem dreary. It's a small space, but it wasn't too crowded when I came here for dinner. The staff were all friendly and the service was great!|Went on a Thursday evening and it wasn't busy at all, my friend and I had the whole restaurant to ourselves. We ordered Tom Yum, Pad Thai, and the Green Mango Salad. I recommend the Tom Yum, the chicken was cook really well, but the soup was a little more on the sour side, so add their chili inside, it is really good! By the way their chili is very spicy, so put a little at first and then add if you need! The Pad Thai and salad were like any normal one I've eaten, so nothing special. I think that the waitress that served us was really trying to get us out of the restaurant because she would come to our table and grab our dishes when we weren't ready, and gave us our bill before we asked. My friend told me how one time she went they were very patient and kind, so I would try this place again to see if they were any different!|I'm torn. The food here is very good and we have been coming here for many years. Last week when a friend and I came in for lunch right at opening. First off the giant oil truck came late and we had to be part of them taking out a huge vat of frying oil from the kitchen straight through the restaurant next to our table and out the door as we were trying to order. The stench and flies were horrible. I know it wasn't their fault the truck came late- but still. The worst part of this experience was our waitress (older short bangs lady) was making the tea or something similar with fresh lemons in the kitchen walkway ( see photo) and as she was mixing it with the chopsticks she was licking them tasting to see if it was sweet enough and then putting it back in the pitcher to adjust the taste! I was disgusted. I can't believe it and now I have to find another place for lunch. I mean come on!! We told the younger gal as we were finished with our meal ( of course that's when we witnessed this) she seemed indifferent . Well ... no more lunches for us. Going to miss your delicious food.  Our business with you is done.Photo is of the lady mixing the drink- geezk|Marnee Thai has been my go to Thai place for years (think like around 20 year!) so this review may be the slightest tiniest bias. LOL! However, through my travels and living in other places I have not had better or more authentic Thai food expect in actually Thailand (there is also a place in Hawaii that comes close.) This restaurant has been here forever and has continuously been one of the best Thai places in sf. And, the owners have been the same too! I always see the lady working here for years! In terms of dishes l, my family always got the same sort of things. The yellow curry, spinach and tofu, sea bass, satay, mango sticky rice, pineapple friend rice, Tom kha, and roti with ice cream... all of these dishes are what keeps us coming back and are definitely highly recommended. In addition, my friends have since recommended the corn pancake and pad Thai.In terms of ambiance, they have a hut inside the restaurant, which could either be considered gimmicky or nice, depending on your preference. Parking can be hard since it is on Irving but should be easier since it is at the tail end of the hot restaurants.|I like the food here, and it is my go-to Thai food place. This past weekend, we ordered the Thai Style Fried Rice and Tom Kha soup to-go (go-to to-go). Both are solid choices in my book! In the past, I've also gotten the Imperial Rolls and Golden Triangles, and they are sooo good and addicting. Anyway, if you're considering this spot for a meal, you totally should try it.|Cutest restaurant! I appreciated the aesthetic of the restaurant. The workers wore traditional clothes which I also loved seeing. We ordered the seafood pad Thai ew and the fried rice, both are the best in SF in my opinion.|Service was good. The pad see ew with chicken was decent. Angel wings was delicious with a good balance of sweet and savory.Pad Thai is a NEVER, it was overly sweet with a wrong amount of sour. Alerted the waiter who was kind enough to tell the owner, who gave no response. Would NOT recommend pad Thai.|This is a solid 3 for me, but was my husband's worst Thai fried rice he'd ever had. I had the noodle dish that comes with fresh crab and it was super delicious! The egg was done to perfection and overall flavor balance was good, with maybe a touch too much of the fish sauce but otherwise nice blend and plenty spicy.The tap waters were terrible, couldn't even bring them near our noses, so strong was the chemical smell. And unbelievably, no bottled water. I had a tea but it also had the same chemical undertones of the unserviceable tap water.The maim issue is how cramped the restaurant is. It's hard to believe that this isn't a fire hazard. The waiting staff are constantly bumping into diners because there is not enough space for them to move freely between tables. So when the orders of the table next to you are being taken, you'll be bumped or at the very least have to pause your conversation until their orders are taken.Husband didn't like his massaman chicken curry at all, nor the duck fried rice which he said was so fatty he couldn't eat the duck. We didn't even take it home with us, we just left it. Mine however was plenty enough for 2 portions, hence it will be lunch tomorrow! He said it was way too noisy, claustrophobic and with constantly getting bumped by waiting staff and other diners, this was not a good experience for him. Probably won't ever be in this specific area ever again but not a lot to draw us back anyway. Seemed very popular among locals," place was packed on a Saturday night.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kin Khao	""|Excellent food", unique menu, very expensive for Thai, and quick paced. Make sure you make a reservation! I called the night before and was so glad they only had 5:45pm and 7:30pm available on a Tuesday evening. Once there, our server was really friendly and helpful. We ended up ordering the vegetarian curry (the fried egg omelette inside is delectable), which I really loved. It comes with rice so no need to order additional rice for two people. We also got their one noodle dish with chicken, which wasn't as great but pretty good. Overall, I recommend this place if you're looking for something different and tasty. Just note the high price point. They have really unique dishes I've never seen at a Thai place before (rabbit and clams?). The main downside of our whole experience was how pushy the hostess was to get us out. Understandably so since it's a popular spot, but my friend and I spoke for a long time since it was the first time we'd seen each other in a year.|When I heard this restaurant had a Michelin Star, I had to try it. We came for a Saturday lunch and had traffic issues, arrived 40 minutes after our reservation time, but they still squeezed us in. Fantastic service!! Usually when I get Thai food, I want insanely satisfying homey and comforting asian food: Pad Thai, Tom yum, etc. Kin Khao is different- a Westerized, upscale take on Thai food while staying true to its flavors. We had the Khao Soi curry noodles and the basil ground pork with a fried egg and rice. Both were carefully thought out well made- we left full and happy. Ultimately, Kin Khao is a fun place to go for upscale Thai food. The food is fantastic with a great atmosphere. But if you're like me, I'd rather find a hole in the wall Thai spot with comfort food tastes for half the price.|Michelin star Thai! The price is so reasonable for what you get. There are some classic like Thai dishes I would skip and go for the unique dishes that you can't find at any other Thai restaurant.The dishes that were great were Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine which was this layered mushroom deliciousness to spread of crispy rice cakes! It was so unique. The nom tok beans were individual beans that were fried crispy that was spicy and limey and salty! It was a great combo of flavors.   Ngop Pla - trout in red curry had a kick. So if you can't handle spice don't order this. It was wrapped in a banana leaf and with sticky rice hit the spot. The pork bowl was a noodle dish with a soft boiled egg that I would skip next time. It did balance out all the other flavors in the other dishes but wasn't anything special. The cocktails were great and used someThai ingredients for a fun twist.It is located at the back end of a hotel and the restroom is a lil confusing. You have to use a hotel key you can get near the host and go through the hotel lobby to enter.|Definitely a mistake coming here.   This is more American Thai than a authentic Thai place.  The menu is very small and the portion is even smaller.  I ordered a rice noodle dish, and the rice noodles are all sticking together.  Thank God I have good chopsticks skills.  I have to separate all the noodles or else it's not very pleasant to eat.   The favor is strong but that's about it.  I switched my chicken to tofu except the server didn't tell me it's fried crispy tofu and not the regular tofu.  Another disappointment.   The calories between fried tofu and regular tofu is HUGE.  For sure a 2nd lunch is needed after this.  BTW, it's inside the hotel and the price is $$$$. $71 for 2 dishes and 2 drinks before tips. The service is fairly rude.  It's like they can't wait to kick us out.  I gave them 2 star because they use metal staw and not Plastic straw. Or else would be ....|Was a walk in , like many of the popular restaurants they set aside a certain amount of seating for them . Get there early enough and you'll have a shot.They seat the reservations first and see what they have available. Super busy spot but the service here is exceptional I can see why they got a Michellin star.I got the Prix Fixe for $65 a person. I think it's pretty good value as I was stuffed by the end.

Kin = eat; Khao = riceJust superb Thai food with great service. I went here during lunch with my company and can highly recommend the """"Ploughman's Lunch""""", if you are offered it or if they return it to the ever-changing menu. This lunch was just a party for your mouth on a plate, full of textures and flavors that have left a lasting, positive, impression.Not the cheapest choice for lunch and a bit hard to find as they are located inside the Parc 55 hotel, (Corner of Mason & Ellis). But they are oh so worth it!|Had time to kill before checking into our hotel and was starving. Thank god we stumbled across this place. The smell alone makes your mouth water. And it does not disappoint!My partner got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich - and he loved it. It's a huge portion for one person. The batter used to dip the chicken in was great with lots of flavor. As well, the deep drying on the chicken was to perfection. Everything it was plated and seasoned with, made a lovely balance.I ordered the Yaowaraj Noodle dish - and its pretty much pad see ew - and it was pretty much amazing and out of this world. I cannot begin to describe the flavors. A must try if you're there (or make someone else order it and try it) - either way. try it! hahaThe staff was friendly and informative with any questions. The address is a bit confusing, as its located on the corner of the hotel.|So, met up with my old college roommate here for dinner since I was staying at the hotel. We didn't have reservations and I had no idea how popular this place is. We were kindly seated at the bar and had such a wonderful experience with our bar tender/sever Mat. We ordered the pre fix menu - it was insane! I think seven or eight courses of creative cuisine. Cheap? no. Worth it? Absolutely! So much fun trying all of these different dishes.  Stand outs were the soup, the pork belly and the beef cheeks. Mat was making all of these crazy drinks and explaining them to us as we ate our dinner so it really was a dinner and a show. Just an awesome experience.|I've been here about 5 times now and the first time, I wasn't the biggest fan but I just ordered the wrong items. I have gone 3 times in the last 5 months, I would recommend making a reservation if you can, or you might be lucky to do a walk in. I was able to walk in on a Tuesday at 6pm and get a table for 3. Items to get, the stone fruit salad - the vinaigrette they use is so tangy it balances the sweet fruit. My favorite is when they had peaches, last night they had melons. The caramelized pork belly, I pick out the fat and only eat the meat but the sauce on sticky rice, the best combo! I would also recommend the flat noodles and wings.  I can see why this place has a Michelin star. The service is great here, my server was so friendly and even remembered me from my last visit.|Been to Kin Khao about half a dozen times now, for both lunch and dinner. It's hard to find a table if you walk-in, so I recommend making a reservation.If you go for dinner, get the caramelized pork belly. Unfortunately, they don't serve this for lunch.Last time, I went for lunch and we ordered the Khao Soi and the pork bowl. The Khao Soi is spicy and delicious. The pork bowl is also good, but could do with slightly more flavor / spice. I forgot which drinks we ordered, but they were also tasty.Kin Khao is one of the only affordable one michelin star restaurants in the city. However, the affordability does not cause a compromise on the quality of this restaurant.|You will be greeted by a appetizing Southeast Asian aroma(mainly fish sauce) before you enter the restaurant, the bartender looks like he just walked out of a Thai soap opera, that helps with the ambience too. I tried the pork bowl, perfectly tender eggs, tasty ground pork, crispy pork shoulder, comforting and tasty broth, only the pork belly is a bit dry. They only have black rice pudding for dessert, which is a bit anticlimactic, though it's cooked to have the right consistency and texture, it's something I can easily make at home too.|Kin Khao is an overly hyped, weird fusion/oddly Americanized/fusion Thai restaurant that doesn't seem to live up to expectations. It's still a nice place to grab dinner, but the prices are unjustifiably inflated with many odd selections to be found on the menu.I ordered the yaowaroj noodles, caramelized pork belly," and stir-fried baby choy sum.I definitely recommend the yaowaroj noodles. They were delicious flat noodles (not unlike the noodles used in pad see ew or pad kee mao) with a that distinct """"Thai"""" flavor and an excellent sauce. The highlight of the meal.I then paid $20 for 4 pieces of fatty pork belly chunks that were covered in some overly sweet", honey-like glaze sauce. I got a stomachache just looking at it and wish I hadn't ordered it and had honestly just spent that $20 on another dish of the yaowaraj noodles.The baby choy sum was good, but then again stir frying vegetables in garlic is hard to mess up. So it didn't necessarily impress me.Overall, come and try this place out for yourself if you're curious, but come early before the lines form for dinner and don't set your hopes too high. This establishment has 1 Michelin star, but won't blow you away with its food.|I was  super excited to try this place especially after seeing food photos and then hearing about the Michelin star. It was definitely a good idea to have a reservation.My friend who's been here had good things to say about the Kanom Jeen Nam Prik so everyone ended up ordering it. It was really delicious! The curry was very flavorful and I thoroughly enjoyed the very crispy fried vegetables. We also ordered the Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine but did not enjoy it as much since the curry is the same or has a very similar flavor. I'm looking forward to coming again for lunch and eventually trying the dinner menu.Update. I came back for dinner and it didn't meet my high expectations. We ordered the rabbit green curry,laab kua (if I remember correctly), Khao kan Jin and black rice pudding. The curry and Kin Khao were decent but not good enough to warrant a craving for it. The waitress recommended we order a sticky rice with the laab since it's spicy but we found it more salty than actually spicy. As someone with a big sweet tooth the rice pudding had very good flavors and textures.|The food is decent. Waitress was too busy to care your feeling. The food is expensive and they want to charge more on top of the high price.Overall, if you want a good food, there are more good Thai place that you can go in the city. If you want do charity, this is a good place to enjoy spending money.|A friend recommended this place to us and we did not realize it was Michelin star restaurant.  It was a Friday night and we were lucky enough to get seated right away. We had our 14month with us and while they had high chairs available (which was appreciated), I wouldn't really consider this place kid friendly..for the atmosphere and definitely for the food options.  Staff was super friendly and food was delicious!  We ordered the wings for our beebs ..with the hot sauce on the side for us..which was delicious, btw. The choy sum veggies were yummy and our main dish of the yaowaraj noodles. They were freaking delicious. And the chicken was so tender. Would def come back here!|This place is just so darn delicious. The fact that you can dine at a Michelin starred restaurant during lunchtime in SF and the most expensive dish is $25 blows my mind. Well played.I've been to Kin Khao numerous times now and can honestly say that the wings are the best in the city. So. Damn. Good. They are my go to starter and the mains I normally split are the flat noodles and little gem salad with poached chicken. Everything is light, fresh and so well seasoned. One of the best lunch options in all of SF. I said it.|This food was TASTY! We were starving, and so happy to find a spot downtown without a super long wait (about 5Minutes!) We weren't sure what to order, so the waiter helped. Everything we got was delicious. Highly recommend!|Full disclosure, I expected big things from a Michelin star, and Toronto and Hawaii have spoiled me with exceptional Thai food (and as these words left my brain, I was struck with the full weight of my undeserved privilege). Thank goodness we had a reservation, because we got there at 5:45 (15 minutes after they open), and there was already a line of about 3 parties. Firstly, service was really average. The lady taking care of us seemed really indifferent was unhelpful. The menu says that this place is a family style restaurant, but when we asked, she just said that we should probably order about 4-5 dishes for 3 people, but that was it. We had to resort to going on yelp (THANK YOU YELP COMMUNITY) to pick dishes. My favourite dish was the Yaowaraj Noodle, which was a lot like a pad see ew with lots of chicken; the vinegar on the side added a completely different, but complimentary flavour profile. We also had the chicken wings, which were good, and not too spicy at all despite the name. They were crispy and came with a really nice sauce that was sweet and slightly  spicy. The worst was definitely  Laab Kua. Now I like my spice (thank you Korean heritage), but this was either accidentally waaaay over spiced, or it was just incredibly spicy.The notes were just really spicy and really salty and intense garlic (which I actually really liked). I've had Laab before, and it was amazing (@sabai sabai), but this was juts a mess of too spicy, too salty AKA heartburn with some veggies. While some of you may be asking why we didn't send it back, it's because I hate that, and unless I find glass in my food, I am unlikely to send it back. The sticky rice was really nice! Would I come back, maybe to try other dishes, like the pork belly that every table was having, but I don't know if I'll be rushing back anytime soon.|Kin Khao is an affordable 1- Michelin star restaurant. The food was good, but it wasn't exceptional maybe I expected too much. I came here at Wednesday night at 5:30 with no reservation but we were seated right away.We ordered caramelized pork belly ($22 sweet, savory, voluptuous pork belly cooked in a cast-iron pot) and dungeness crab & betel leaf curry ($55 spicy, tangy southern curry with local dungeness crab meat and betel leaves, served with a side of sen lee rice noodles, garlic oil). Both dishes were delicious. The pork belly was very soft and flavorful but it was on the fatty side. Curry was delicious but I'm not sure if I want to get this dish again. It was good but nothing too special. It was just typical curry with crab meat. Personally I think curry was not worth $55. Next time I would like to try their prix fixe menu! Overall it was just ok. I am not sure what the hype is about.|Had to come back for more especially now that they have their Michelin star. Though honestly it's still one of the chillest and most casual Micheline dining experiences I've ever had. Food has been great both times I've been here. Some items are amazing while others are just good but the price isn't bad, there's never been to long of a wait, and I've always left happy. The only downside to my visit this time was the service. They were friendly but we had a really difficult time waving anyone down for help.For our meal we got the following:1) Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine (Curry Mousse in a jar w/ mushrooms served w/ crisp rice cake): Despite the fact that this was my least favorite item during my last visit (not to say I didn't really like it) I found myself craving the creamy mousse and their wonderfully crisp rice cake.  The bit of coconut at the top provides some nice sweet relief to the slight heat from the curry. It's the same as the first time and I still really like it. (4/5)2) Khao Kan Jin (Pork + Rice + Blood Sausage in a banana leaf w/ garlic chips + fried & raw shallots w/ cilantro and lime): My main entree. Not quite an entree size which is sad cause it's freaking delicious. I am addicted to that sticky rice w/ the blood. Then when you add all the herbs both fresh and fried and top it with cilantro, there's just so much goodness in each bite. Only downside is the price to portion (4.75/5)3) Khao Mun Gai (Chicken Fat Rice w/ Ginger Poached Chicken w/ Cup of chicken broth): Friend's entree. This is more of an entree size. Rice has some background taste of chicken fat but not as rich as she hoped. Chicken was very moist and well made though not super flavorful but the sauce was there to fix that. The real star though was that random cup of broth. We almost didn't want to drink it cause it was just so amazing. It looks like your average chicken broth but it has the richness and concentrated flavor of gravy. It's magical (4.5/5)Overall," I really love this place. I'm glad it has a Michelin star though I don't know if it's elevated to that level but then again it's just a name and the award is kinda arbitrary so whatever.  It's upscale Thai food and it's good. Will definitely be back.---The Re-return: Khao Kan Jin + Magic Chicken Broth---""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Osha Thai Restaurant	|Recently returned to this SF Thai restaurant", and it is still as savory and delicious as I remember.  The duck curry is spot on.  My secret...order the Crab Fried Rice and ADD DUCK....mind blown.  Brings back those fond memories of Infusion Lounge...Four stars only because it is street parking only, and you might wind up wandering through some pretty rough neighborhoods to get there (i.e. the Tenderloin). Not exactly family friendly. If there's anything I miss about being a city dweller, it's high quality, hole-in-the-wall specialty cuisine restaurants like this one.|Literally the only Osha that was able to be courageous enough to add the right amount of spice to my pad Thai. I've been a loyal Osha fan and have visited all of them, but would say that this one had one of the best presentation and portion size. Compared to the one located at 4 Embarcadero, I'd say this one is much better. Love a place that has tofu in their pad Thai along with your choice of meat :) they also have $3 beers during happy hour! Definitely can't beat that.|Very poor experience. I call to place an order for pickup at 11:05 pm (their website says they are open until midnight on Thursday) and am told that their kitchen closes at 10:30. They tell me I must place my order and then have it sit to wait until the 11:05 pickup (so 30+ minutes of food just sitting). This is very poor service and it's misleading when your website says one thing but your employees say another.|Found this spot while we were walking to china town. We love Thai food so we gave it a chance. Got in right when they opened so we were the first customers in there. Great options on the menu. We ordered tofu and shrimp pad Thai with Thai iced tea. Pad Thai was very delicious and portions was great. Thai iced tea was presented with a mason jar which was cool. My wife said it was perfect, but for me I wanted it sweeter. Great place for Thai food.|The approach to the restaurant is not the best. once inside the ambience is decent. The food is above average. The spice level is not the usual, lower than other Thai places I ate in. The options for vegetarian food, like most Thai places, are good. If in the neighborhood would go here, but not drive down for this place exclusively. The staff is friendly.|I had the Spicy Rad Nah here and it was a bit different from the ones I'm used to having but still pretty good. Generally the ones I have are plainer with just a black bean sauce on top of the noodles but this one has a bit more spice as well as a few more veggies.That being said it has some improvements it could make. The noodles could be cooked a bit better so that they are less broken before the sauce is put on. But other than that the dish was pretty good and I'm sure the other items are rather well made based on what I saw at my table.|Best tom yum. Outstanding noodles. Fun staff. Reasonable priced. Clean. What's not to like about this place.|Good portion sizes but really just so-so thai food. I saw the line at the ramen place a few storefronts away and decided on Thai for a late dinner. I probably should have waited the 40 minutes for a really good meal. When I was seated the place was 1/3 full and I literally waited for 10 minutes before a server breezed around the corner - I had to flag her down to order. Between my mom and I we ordered the papaya salad (first option) with tofu - it was super tough and hard to chew the tofu! Next we had the shrimp pad see ew with the clear noodles, and the shrimp pad mee krao. The pad see ew was a 3/5, but nothing to write home about. The pad mee krao was the better option between the two, but the noodle to ingredients ratio was too big.|This is a gem, my girlfriend and i come here (an hour and a half drive) to enjoy this place together. The calamari is delicious and fresh (no picture cause we always devour it) and the dish we get is a little strange but we love the pad see ew but with silver noodles!|Pretty tasty at the onset, maybe because I was starving and hadn't eaten all day, but not awful. The ambiance and cleanliness of restaurant looked much more appealing and inviting online. In the case of pictures lying, I'd venture to say that the pics deceived me. Not to mention, there was a couple inside with a hollering baby, and that did not help at all! No fault of the restaurant, of course. I'm just saying- it was awful. Ha!I wouldn't spread the word about this place, but I'd eat there on a late night after a concert and drinks. Hope this helps!|Its a great restaurant. Service is very nice and food is good. I ate here couple of times because my friend lives next door, so you can say it was convenient. I didn't know Osha was a chain restaurant, but I see that vibe in it because it doesn't feel super homie and comfortable. I would recommend whatever you order make sure they let you know how spicy it is even though on the manu it says mild. I ordered a salad, it said mild and I confirmed with a waitress to make sure its not too spicy, she said its little spicy but not too bad. I could barely eat the salad yet along taste the flavor. It was SUPER spicy. I ended up eating the whole thing because I didn't want to waste it, but I def learned my lesson by not fully trusting waitresses in Thai restaurants about spices. I know we all tolerate spices differently, but that salad was not mild at all.The food is great but nothing too special or memorable.|Out of all the osha thais in SF, this is by far the best location. It is also the first restaurant out of all three! I came here with my coworkers and had an amazing lunch. The servers were constantly checking up on us and refilled our water without us having to ask. We had the raw shrimp and angel wings as appetizers. For the main dishes we ordered their volcanic beef, pad thai, and curry fried rice. The beef was tender and savory with a hint of sweetness as well as their pad thai. As for the fried rice, what restaurant messes that up? ‍ Price is way cheaper than the Osha at Embarcadero which I feel caters to a different crowd. Quality/ quantity of food is best at this location as well!|Had a great meal here a few days back, I had their signature Tom yum soup and it was delicious. The service was kind and attentive and my friend was well pleased with her meal as well. Will be back.|After dining here, i can understand why this place has lots of reviews but 3.5 stars only. If you've never had Thai food before, you will like this place. The food is just okay to me. It's not the worst but not the best. You can get the same food elsewhere with a cheaper price. Roasted duck curry - sweetVolcano beef - taste good but the beef was overcooked. It's sweet and spicyThai tea - mediocre|Wow, this place offers ridiculously excellent service. The food is also good, but the service is like no other! From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeted with nothing other than the biggest grins and kindness from the host and servers. Its almost creepy how seriously nice they all were! lol. We were hungry travelers and we ordered a panang curry, spicy eggplant w chicken, and pad knee mao with egg noodle (per our server's suggestion). My dude is really sensitive to spice bc of really bad heartburn, and he was assured that the pad khee mao has no chile/spice. When we were served, his first bite of the noodles (which he said were delicious) was quite spicy. I tried them myself and they had a slight kick. To my beau's sensitive heartburn, that really didn't fare well. We really reluctantly asked our server if there was anything we could exchange it for. He apologized for the dish and right away brought out a pad see ew since it is really without chile. The manager was so kind and apologetic and was periodically checking up on us. I had a coughing fit while i was eating my own dish (I was sick with a cold) and they nearly came rushing to ask me if my dish was too spicy. I can handle my spice and it was really my sickness that threw me into the coughing fit. We were really taken aback by how kind they were and how attentive they were to our sensitivities. Oh and I nearly forgot to mention that the plates are HUGE!!! Im used to paying a much lower price for thai food in Orange County, but bc the plates were so huge here it was really not a big deal. Highly recommend this restaurant!! Delicious, quick turnaround and excellent service from all staff.|Truly pleased and fully satisfied with everything that was ordered.My friend and I ordered and shared different dishes, ALL were cooked well and beautifully presented.I m quiet picky when it comes to sea food, for me it just has to be cooked well.ALL of it was impeccably cooked to perfection yet they were extremely busy.Service was fine, not extra attentive though, a bit rushed and cold , but their food overcomes it and still get me to give it 5stars without a doubt.Coconut based sea foodTOM KHA,  it's delicious. Sea food was well cooked, various and abundant! Was my friend choice but I would probably reorder it!Crunchy calamari 8$ish SO SO SO GOOD!!! Cooked to perfection! Asked for the siracha cream sauce on the side sauce on the side , it was a bit spicy but paired wonderfully with the calamari and was very pleasing. Would definitely Reorder this! In my honest opinion, A MuST tryMango Salad:Delicate , tasty, just an explosion of flavor in the mouth! Comes with abundant grilled prawns , also very well cooked. It's quiet spicy but balanced by the sweet and crunchy mango.Would recommend and reorder it for sure!Crisp Salmon ( chef specials menu ) 18$ishLightly fried , very well prepared, juicy and simply delish it's Crispy salmon topped with tamarind-caramelized onion sauce, cilantro. Have asked for the sauce on the side. And a side of STICKY RICE (definitely the stickiest rice I have ever had!!!) Would absolutely recommend and reorder it over and over again. It was really a party in my mouth!!!Angry prawns , chef specials menu:Sautéed river prawns with red curry paste, bell peppers, kaffir lime leaf served over fried eggplant. My friend order a side of brown rice (best brown rice everrr!)Good dish , probably my least favorite though but prawns were impeccably cooked and good and eggplant were really really tasty, soft mouth melting like!If you haven't tried this place, well you are missing out on a food experience made of tasty, colorful, perfectly cooked and artistically presented UNIQUE dishes!Can't wait to come back!!!Update!!Went back during a busy busy weekend and well... this place still deserves its 5stars!!!Tried new dish:Special chef menu:Spicy cat fish. Not so spicy for me and my Korean friend! However very good! Eggplant were soft and yummy , curry sauce was delicate but tasty! We both loved it.SIDES :She chose EGGS FRIED RICE , YummiiiiI went for the COCONUT RICE , also very delish!!! Cannot recommend this place enough!!!|On a Saturday night at 2 am after a Halloween party. I guess this is where many party goers came to refuel. As expected and usual on a weekend it's packed . For a party of 3 we waited for 30 minutes for our table. Sat us in the back lower level eating area, last table next to the bathroom. Would have been a 4 stars reviews. Except when ever someone needs to use the restroom they line up next to our table. when the bathroom door opens and closes I can smell the stench of the bathroom odors. ;( and noticed every time the door is opened I can see the men's urinal , saw the garbage was over flow with paper towels scattered all over the floors.With that I lost my appetite, didn't even eat half of my food. Yuk!!!!! My two other guests did mentioned the horrendous smells and they couldn't consumed their food either.For any future patrons avoid sitting at the way back tables to your right hand side facing the toilet. You been warned!!!!!!|We had the best and quickest Thai  meal I've ever had outside of Thailand. Killed it! It was out of control how fast they made the food such quality food. Can't wait to return!|Food was a 3.5, but service was so good that I'm going to to round it up to a 4.0.I came to Osha Thai on a Saturday night with a couple of friends who were craving Thai food. I was glad to find that the menu had so many vegetarian options! Yay :D I was so conflicted about what I wanted and was really torn between a noodle soup and tom kha and was super happy that they had a tom kha noodle soup! I went with the tom kha noodle soup with egg noodles. Portion wise, the dish was HUGE and super filling. Flavor wise, the tom kha was not as crisp as I would have liked and the coconut flavor was somewhat muddled and almost diluted. The egg noodles were also a tad bit overcooked. Service was great and our waiter dropped by multiple times, kept our waters refilled, and made sure that we had a great dinner.|They dont play peanut butter and country chicken is so great with the tom yun soup really appreciate all the work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Marnee Thai	""|This place was good but not amazing.Papaya salad: overly fishy in my opinion and just lack luster all aroundWe also got a work chicken dish. This was good but I wasn't a fan of the ground chicken and again heavy use of fish flavor. It was just a bit much. But the spice was really njce. We also got padkhee Mao which was good and the beef was extremely tender.The dessert was SO GOOD black sticky rice with fried banana and coconut ice cream..an amazing combo. Pretty standard for most Thai places I'd say|I would give this place an extra star if  it weren't so loud or if it was easier to order online   Food is good if a little expensive I always feel slightly frazzled by the entrance which is very small always crowded|This restaurant was a great find near the San Francisco Botanical Gardens! We were in town visiting and decided to see what was within walking distance of the gardens", and I'm glad we chose Marnee Thai. It was right across the street and took us about 2 minutes to walk there. The restaurant wasn't too crowded when we arrived around 5:30 pm, so we were able to get seated and served quickly. Food (5/5):The selection of food here was great and it all came out tasting amazing! I got Pad Thai (I know," basic) but still GOOD. My husband got a pork dish off the """"Specials"""" menu that was suggested by the waitress. It came with sticky rice and I'm pretty sure I stole 75% of his rice. My sister got a chicken dish (wow I wish I could remember the name) and it was on the """"Chef's suggestions"""" list. All 3 dishes were SO good (we are a sharing type of family). There was some spicy sauce on the table so that you could add heat to your liking. Price (5/5): The pricing here was INCREDIBLE for San Francisco. At dinner we all paid $13 - $14 for a main dish. WOW. Service (5/5): Our server was friendly and gave super helpful suggestions. We really enjoyed being at her table!|EVENT: just your casual weekday... you know... went out for a run at the park... and we're feeling hungers! And all you can think about is food", food... thaiiiii fooddd... Mmm! **Drools**SERVICE: great service! Greeted us right away and found us a table by the door.FOOD: we only had a few dishes... well, just two but I'm eager to visit once again to try other delish food. Here's what we got....(1) Tom Yum Chicken Soup: sweet and tangy flavors! Tom Yum is my favorite thai dish to order! But, this soup here is made very well here with fresh mushrooms (unlike straw/canned mushrooms) Highly recommend it! 5 stars!!!(2) Pad See Ew: another favorite dish to order. Well made! Although on the sweeter side - 4 stars!**OVERALL: recommend getting the tom yum soup! 4 stars!|To me, four stars means I'll go if my friends want to but I wouldn't suggest it. Three stars means I'd fight to go somewhere else. I didn't fight this time, because my main beef with this place is that it's too expensive and I was on a work outing. Northern Thai Style Tea Leaf Salad $12.50Crispy Oven Baked Pork Belly with hot chili paste and green beans, $15.95Spicy Angel Wings $8.75Tea Leaf Salad was good! I shared with the group and everybody loved it. I would order this again, maybe as my main. Spicy Angel Wings were also good, but not so good that it's a must-order. Crispy Pork Belly ... the skin was hard, not crispy, and kept cutting stuck between my teeth. I wouldn't order it again.|Dropped in with a friend on a weeknight and was met with quite a crowd! We were lucky to get a table in about 15 minutes because the wait was incredibly long after we were seated! Being the basic human being that I am, I went with the spicy ma keur -- aka the spicy eggplant with mushrooms, fried tofu, baby corn, bell pepper, chili, garlic, and Thai basil. It's usually my go to dish because I absolutely love eggplant and Marnee Thai's version of it did not disappoint! It went super well with the brown rice that I got on the side and had a great stand alone flavor as well~ Definitely considering making reservations or going in early if you want to avoid a large wait or have a larger group. Such a yummy option for thai food!|I found it to be good standard thai. I'm only giving it three stars because I had heard so much about how good it was and I found that it was just normal.Having said that I thought the food was good. We got the Tom ka which was solid. The veggie pad Thai was a little strange I thought maybe just a little too saucy? Basil pork and summer rolls were also just pretty normal. Probably the thing I thought was the best was the Thai Samosa.It was pretty crowded on a Sunday at dinner time but we were still able to get a table. The service was quick. Our waiter was helpful. One of our party is allergic to fish and we learned that if you ask for anything without fish sauce in it they can make it for you, it just takes longer.All in all I don't really have any complaints or any raves so I guess I'm for it!|This restaurant is a bit small, but the food is good overall.We started off with two appetizers, the mango avocado salad and crab cakes. The salad had a spicy twang to it and was pretty good. As for the crab cakes, the outside was very crispy but there was so little crab inside that it was hard to discern the taste at all.For my main, I had the yellow curry with chicken. Absolutely recommend this dish. Crunchy bites, interspersed with tender chicken and potato, bring this classic to life. One of my favorite choices, especially sprinkled over rice.|Ever have a meal that was so delicious that you can't stop thinking about it days later? Well for me, Marnee Thai did just that. Unfortunately, this little neighborhood hole in the wall gem is in San Fransisco's beautiful Inner Sunset neighborhood, a thousand plus miles from my home in Dallas. So I'll have to recreate some of their delicious menu items it at home. But for those who are in the area, listen up! Do yourself a favor and get the shrimp mango salad with spicy dressing. It's divine. Fresh shrimp and avocado on a bed of lettuce, a vibrant mix of Thai flavors and a fiery red house dressing that took it over the top. We also tried the panang curry which was impressive as well.The place itself is cute, but small and to the point. But who cares since you're probably not going here for the ambiance. The service is decent but unremarkable and there isn't a lot of seating, so don't come with a large party. But who cares? Their food is totally worth it!|Not bad, not great! I had recently watched Anthony Bourdain's episode in Thailand and came away with such a craving for good Thai food. I realize it's hard to get truly authentic Thai food here, but was still looking to be transported to the land of fiery spice, freshness, and interesting flavor combinations . My destination of choice - Marnee Thai 9th Avenue.The place was hopping the Saturday evening we dined there. People were spilling out the door and lined the skinny entrance way. Fortunately, we made reservations via Yelp (yay yelp!) and we're seated instantly. Great start!Service was efficient, but almost too efficient. Menus and water were served immediately upon being seated, but we had to wait a little too long to order despite making eye contact with several servers to indicate our readiness.Nevertheless, we finally ordered - all from the Specials:- hot cakes - interesting! Slightly sweet rice flour and coconut batter baked into soft custard-like clouds and topped with corn kernels, kabocha squash slivers. This reminded me of a savory maja Blanca - a Filipino dessert-tea leaf salad - tasty, but not the best I've ever had. This one had fresh greens (romaine), but the tea leaf mash was too salty and definitely needed acids to balance it- curry mousse snapper - so interesting! Great combination of soft curry mousse and hearty fish. I'd enjoy this on a cold winter night.- shrimp pad Thai - I had such high hopes for this as I've had it here before and it was AHMAZING! I had dreamt about it for YEARS since it became the gold standard of Pad Thais. Not so much this rime around :( Texture was spot on, but it was severely lacking acid to balance all the sweetness. It certainly was not bad, but again fell short.Overall, it is very good! Everything was freshly prepared and tasty - just not as balanced as I had hoped.|Good curry with beef. the beef is a little dry though. I think Im pretty like juicy meat.|I came here for dinner on Father's Day with my family and i have only ever visited the location in the lower sunset but this place is just as good! Reservations are easy to make on Yelp/OpenTable. For a party of 5, we were seated shortly after checking in and the waiters are very attentive and efficient. They explained the menu very well and announced their specials before leaving to get our water. Must get dishes are the Angel Wings, Pad See Ew and the Pad Thai. Classic dishes that are extremely well executed and super tasty. We also ordered Sea bass with yellow curry and Tom Yum soup. Both tasty as well. We did not get a chance to order dessert because we were so full! But the sticky rice with Mango looked very good and one of my favorite desserts i definitely need to save room for this next time!The restaurant gets pretty packed and the layout is pretty narrow but still a good place for a large group + kids.|Came here for lunch with friends.We arrived around 1pm and they were a bit busy.But we were seated So surprised that this place is highly-awarded for its food.We ordered Beef Salad($9.95), Kang Keaw (Green Curry)($11.95) and BBQ Chicken($13.95).Taste pretty good and fresh.Service was okay. Pricing is reasonable in San Fran.Highly recommended for ppl who wanna try Thai food in town.|I actually hate going to the same restaurant more than once. But this is the second time I've been to this restaurant in less than a week and I ain't even mad. Food is just amazing here. I really don't know how to capture the deliciousness with the words. The first time I came here, I got the pad Kee Mao with prawns. Magnificent. I just went today and got the Woonsen vegetarian. Astounding. Their wine choices are also pretty good however, I'd probably get a cocktail since they're only one dollar more. Food is also cooked pretty fast. For a group of 10 people, we only waited about 10 minutes after we ordered for the food to come out.Overall, just a wonderful food experience. Highly recommended. Bring the whole fam, they've got group seating in the back!|We came in for dinner around 6:30 pm on a Saturday night and it was super busy. We had to wait to get a table and waited a very long time to get our food. It was super cramped and tight in terms of seating. The restaurant isn't that big so all of this took away from the overall experience.The tables next to us all had water upon seating but I had to ask for ours. Other people who were seated at the same time as us also got their food first. One of the tables next to us was given food and had it taken away just before they ate it because it was for another table.However the food was very good. I'm vegan so I ordered the jasmine rice with praram phak. This consists of assorted fresh vegetables like cauliflower or broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn and fried tofu with peanut curry sauce (with coconut milk). It was delicious. The peanut curry sauce tasted very good.When I ordered I specifically asked that no oyster sauce and no fish sauce be included in my order and the waitress said it was vegetarian so it didn't include it and not to worry but I'm skeptical because one of the items in their vegetarian menu section says it is made of oyster sauce in the description. I hoped mine didn't have any and thought the chances were good since it wasn't included in this items description and the waitress said it was fine.I would recommend for the food but warn you not to come at a busy time. My fellow vegans and vegetarians, be sure to double check for any fish or oyster sauces to be safe.|For a small restaurant , they sure are busy and definitely short staffed but they proved to be very attentive. We had a group of 11 people total . We were sat in the separate room in the back. Fairly small but can probably hold about 30ish people. The menu is very large.. so it was kind of hard to pick... so we went on yelp to see what we're their most ordered dishes. A P P E T I Z E R S Angel Wings (3/5 Stars) - I didn't read the description and I honestly thought they were the stuffed wings .. but they weren't . They tasted almost like Buffalo Wild Wings asian zing wings . They weren't bad though. Came out nice and hot . Drenched in sauce . Imperial Rolls (3.5/5 stars) - these fried rolls weren't bad. They're not the typical meaty type of egg rolls . They have clear noodles and shrimp inside. Not sure what else we're in there. The wrap is very thin so it gets crumbly. Not too bad though...E N T R E E S Honestly .. all the food tasted REALLLLLYYY good cause they brought out this hot sauce that was for the Thai fried rice ... and omg that sauce tho. Bommbbbb AF ! with everything ! I wished I could buy the sauce and take it home . Thai Fried Rice (5/5 stars) - I actually really liked this dish !! Cause of the hot sauce it came with ! But even alone it was good. Not too salty . Not sweet . Just right :) Chan Pad Poo (3.5/5 stars) - This dish was good but it wasn't like OMGGG GOOOD .. it was one of the more common pics I saw on yelp. So I thought I'd try it. Glad I did . But it was mehhishhh. Pad Siew (4/5 Stars) - can never really go wrong with this dish. It tastes the same at almost every Thai place . But it was actually better than most places. So I do recommend trying it :) The one thing I do give 5 stars to is to our water guy ! Even though it was busy, he never let my tiny cup go to empty. And he's not even watching me kill my water . Ahhaha. He just knewww. You the best ! Wished I got his name. He worked in the back room around 6ish PM on 6/10/18 :)|Definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in the area. The food here is super flavorful and well balanced. The prices are reasonable while the portion sizes are good. I've been to both this location and the one in Irving and both are consistently tasty. I've only been here for dinner so the restaurant is always dimly lit with lively chatter. My favorite things to order here are the spicy angel wings, chan pad poo, and red curry with either roasted duck or chicken! The angel wings are perfectly crispy and are coated in this magnificent​ sweet and spicy sauce. I love the fried basil as a garnish on the dish! Chan pad poo is stir-fried spicy rice noodles with crab meat and egg in a chili garlic sauce. It tastes like pad thai but on the more acidic side! It has a great kick to​ it and is not too spicy. The curries here are on the lighter side and less dense than the coconut curries I'm used to. However, still very tasty when accompanied by​ some sticky rice!If you're ever in the mood for some Thai food, Marnee Thai is the way go! It will be sure to satisfy your taste buds and make your tummy happy :)|Man I used to love Marnee! But last night I was walking by and and thought some takeout would be nice. I ordered and paid and went to the book store for a bit. Came back and saw my dish ready to be handed to me. Instead a staff member understood that I ordered brown rice and was not charged the extra 50 cents. She took it upon herself to dig deep into how this could happen, yelled at 5 employees, the kitchen and then re-rang up my order and gave me a new bill. Very detailed I guess but if you want that extra 50 cents just ask me and let me go. Instead it was another 15 minutes of waiting. When I showed surprise at this amount of time for such a small amount of money she told me not to talk. Maybe she was having a bad day? In any case, Marnee I know you can do better. Bussaba is around the corner and is better Thai food if you ask me.|When my sister lived in the Bay Area, I would hear her speak of Marnee Thai often. So when a friend suggested that we meet there for dinner, I was looking forward to the meal.We started with the papaya salad without shrimp. When it came out, the portion was a nice size and there were tomatoes in it, which was unusual but a welcomed sight. We dug in and after a couple of bites, it was clear that the chef had a very heavy hand with the spicy lime dressing. It was so hot, to the point where we could only eat a few bites. My mouth was on fire. I then became concerned about the curry I had ordered. Our waitress clearly had the same thought so she brought over a spoonful of the curry for me to taste before our entrees came out.I got the green curry with vegetables and my friend ordered the pad prig khing with chicken. The green curry was not as rich or as thick as I'm used to So the vegetables were not really coated in it. Neither Andrea came with rice so we ordered two sides of brown rice. Everyone around us had the homemade hot cakes that they appeared to be really enjoying. If we ever return, that is definitely what we should try.I am not sure if this place has gone downhill over the last several years or if we just didn't order the right things. My sister loved the pad see ew there and I'm guessing that that is what I should've gotten. But, despite our being underwhelmed by the food, given it's proximity to the UCSF medical center, the place was really booming and benefitting from the after work crowd.|This place is highly-awarded for its food - and rightly so! The food definitely met the hype. My vegetarian pad Thai was so delicious as well as the samosas I shared with my friend. The food arrived quickly too.My only complaint was that I felt rushed ordering so...not the friendliest service I've ever had. Nevertheless," it was really easy making our reservation over the phone and the food was everything. Definitely recommended!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine	""|Incredibly fun atmosphere for any occasion", be it a casual lunch or a group dinner celebration. The menu offers all the staples: fried noodles, curries, meat dishes accompanied by a generous array of sides. At dinner, there's also a waiter walking around carrying street food that you can grab for your table. Whether it's in presentation or taste, all the items have a creative spin to it, and the meal is truly a feast for the taste buds and the eyes. I've tried many items and liked them all, but fell in love with their yellow curry recently. The accompanying roti is seriously amazing. Expect a lively atmosphere with multiple interruptions throughout the meal as the staff celebrates birthdays all around you. They even provide sparklers, and I'm pretty sure will let you bring in your own cake too.|I love this place. The food is a little pricey, but given the quality of food and the cool environment, I will pay a little more for Thai food than other places.The place can get loud where they sometimes have drum line parades for people's bdays and also given all the people that fill up the restaurant it's definitely a place that sometimes you may need to try to out talk the person next to you so your friends can hear.I appreciate that they mention what items they can make gluten free. Ive had many of their items and for the most part really liked it including the fried rice with shrimp, pad se ew, and drinks. I was disappointed by their eggplant dish... I love eggplant and for the price you would expect a good portion of it. I remember I got the dish with my friend and we both were in disbelief that we only got 4-5 pieces of eggplant. In my opinion I don't think it's worth getting again.I also have enjoyed the drinks. I've gotten the bowl which is strong and we shared at a table of 4. Last time I got a sake based sangria and it was really good! However, I tried my friend's flower spritzer and it had a really weird after taste...|This was the BEST restaurant that I visited on my trip to San Fran. This was kind of hard to find at first as the area is pretty quiet and 'warehouse-y' feels. I made a reservation but got here early and was hoping to get seated earlier but it was a full house. We did get seated about 45 minutes later from when we arrived which was still earlier than our original reservation time! Also, food is very instagram worthy!This place is VERY loud at night which I wasn't a fan of. They literally do a lion dance on people's birthdays. There were probably 5 different birthdays the night I was there and I probably went deaf LOL. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 thai ice teas, ahi scoops, hat yai fried chicken, and panang neua. Thai ice tea - Delicious very standard thai ice tea. This place serves it with two snow/ice balls on top. I'm not sure what purpose it serves but was pretty.Ahi scoops - Ahi scoops was good but nothing memorable. I would get again but I wouldn't crave for it.Hat yai fried chicken - This dish is delicious. Listen to everyone else and get this! Chicken was fried to a crisp but the meat was SO juicy. I'm pretty sure it was chicken breast too. Served with a sweet chilli sauce. Dish comes with blue rice, roti and curry. Penang Neau - The braised pork was delicious as well. Worth the price as they do not skimp on the meat. The meat is so tender it literally falls off the bones. Also served with rice and onions/peppers.This will be a go to spot if I am ever in San Fran again. Farmhouse was the most memorable restaurant for me.|Mr. Farmhouse...You are amazing. I pay an arm and leg each time to eat here, but that is the thing.. I actually walk away saying.. that was totally worth it.I know, I know, people like me will always say... I'll never pay that much money for Asian food! I can just go to XXX restaurant and pay $10 for good decent Asian food! Why would I pay $$$ for the same thing!Foolish hobbit. I am just like them actually... but I tell them, just trust me and go. Not... by yourself or just randomly. But on a special occasion, open up that little wallet of yours and just give it a try. You won't regret it. I've been hear a few times now and each time I come to see you I think... it couldn't have possibly been that good. What am I doing? But then man does the food live up to the hype every time.Your 24 hour beef noodle soup. Amazing. Wait what is that GIANT leg of some god forsaken animal doing in my soup. (sorry for that graphic image. extra sorry to vegetarians, but OH MY)Your Hat Yai Fried Chicken. How do you make it so crispy yet light, yet filling. I must learn how to fry a chicken like that. I'll be back. I will be back...|Delectable Thai food, in the Mission! Right off of the main strip, and adjacent to Southern Pacific Brewing, lies this little gem! There is easy parking and public transport to this area.They have a fun, colorful awning and some art on the wall outside. The inside has a modern feel to it, but the wall to their kitchen has tin awning kind of like most houses in Thailand. So kind of rustic modern. Unlike other authentic places in the city, this eatery cares about presentation. When I went the host had an authentic Thai costume on, and there was a guy with a chili hat walking around with a carrying pole with two buckets that had an arraying of chili sauces to try. It does get loud seeing as the space is somewhat on the smaller side. The do have a nice long communal table," so I wouldn't be scared to come with a large group!Be careful when they say """"Thai spicy""""!!! This place actually means it. I came in knowing exactly what I wanted because I had seen something on Instagram. We got the cup noodles with braised beef and seafood fried rice. Everything was flavored appropriately with all the right ingredients", except the noodles! I accidentally asked for Thai spicy and and after a couple bites, it was hard to eat. They also have a nice wine list, which isn't very Thai," but I really appreciated it because who doesn't like good wine with dinner. Their desserts also mean business! Check out my photos for the beautifully presented """"Bread Pudding."""" It comes with a Kouign-Amann style """"bread"""" and vanilla ice cream. I'll definitely be returning to have those noodles again with less spice", and to actually read the whole menu!|My new favorite Thai restaurant in SF! I always enjoy eating Thai foods whenever I go to Portland and I thought there's nothing like that here in the bay area, until I found Farmhouse! We ordered:- chicken wings(good, crunchy)- neua num tok rolls(very good! The beef melts in your mouth!)- hat yai(huge portion! Everything on this plate taste really good)- panang neua(soooo good!, the blue rice is just like regular white rice, no taste)- 24 hours beef noodle soup(great! Good broth, the short ribs is very good too!)Will definitely return. Parking is a bit tough though, only street parking. I didn't see any parking lot/garage nearby.|Unfortunately I didn't find the dining environment particularly comfortable. It was like dining in a nightclub with loud music and people shouting over each other. I had a really hard time having a decent conversation with my friend because we could barely hear each other. I think next time, I will just take my food to go!Otherwise, the food was pretty bomb. We ordered the Neua Num Tok Rolls as our appetizer and got the Hat Yai Fried Chicken and Pad Thai for our entrees. I would highly recommend going with a large group of friends so that you can try an assortment of the menu items! The pad thai was decent, but there was nothing particularly special about the Farmhouse pad thai. I thought the Hat Yai Fried Chicken was a very unique dish though! The chicken breast is deep fried to perfection. The outside was crispy but the inside was super tender and juicy. My mouth is watering just thinking of it! The buttery, coconut curry served with the chicken went well with the rice and the roti (which was also perfectly cripy on the outside and doughy on the inside). My only gripe was about how little of the curry there was on our plate! It barely covered the bottom of its serving bowl and was dressed with just two lone pieces of potato. I would have appreciated a more generous portion of the curry!!They do a pretty fun routine for people celebrating their birthdays at the restaurant. I'm not sure if this is something you have to coordinate beforehand, but they do a little song-and-dance (actually a very LOUD song-and-dance) and present the birthday boy/girl with a plate of dessert and some props for photos. It was quite entertaining to watch!|How has it taken so long for me to review one of my go-to's in San Francisco?Farmhouse Kitchen is such a unique dining experience with exquisite food. My wife and I were fortunate enough to discover this place when it first opened," but it quickly became a hotspot for the """"new Mission crowd"""" on any given night", so definitely make a reservation if you can!My favorite dish (and really the only thing I ever order) is the Panang Neua--a house special that depicts a dish the head chef would serve to his family. It is a bone-in short rib topped with panang curry served with blue rice. It is tasty, fall-of-the-bone tender and very filling! I can never bring myself to order anything else. My wife always orders the Hat Yai Fried Chicken, which comes with curry, roti, and rice--also flavorful and sizable.*Highly recommend coming here for a birthday and having the staff sing to the celebrant. Even better if you can, come here for Thai New Year.  Farmhouse really creates a festive dining experience on this night with Muy Thai exhibitions, cultural dancing and singing, games," and dishes individually served """"dim-sum style.""""|A really fun Thai place! The host who greeted us had the most amazing", vibrant traditional (?) costume on, and the interior is just as colorful and fun. We came for an early dinner on Saturday night and there was a pretty short wait (by the time we left, though, the line that had formed was very long so be sure to plan ahead)!I took off a star because of value for the price point. We got pad thai with tofu (15) which was very fragrant and flavorful. However, the grilled prawns (~23 I think) -- while beautifully presented in a coconut -- weren't worth it, as I'm pretty sure there were only about 6-8 shrimp in the whole thing? Nevertheless I had a ball eating this meal, especially because I didn't expect the blue flower rice to actually be blue (I'm easily entertained, clearly).|Our lunch was very delayed because there was some issue with staff missing keys. I wasn't there, but my friend who called in the lunch order and went to Farmhouse right when they opened on a Sunday (noon) basically had to wait outside with a growing crowd for 30 minutes before he could get inside and get the lunch he'd pre-ordered. Nonetheless, the food here never really disappoints. And is legit spicy!I'm not sure exactly what our friend ordered but here's my best description of the dishes below:* Leaf-Wrapped Salmon - 3.5 starsSoft texture, interesting with a pesto-like sauce. I do like my salmon a little pink and undercooked, so I would've preferred that. But the leaf keeps the filet nice and moist.* Yellow curry w/ eggplant, string beans - 3.5 starsGreat flavor, and love the crunch to the veggies, but wow this is spicy!* Spring Rolls - 3 starsFine but a bit plain/boring compared to the other dishes!* Beef w/ Rice - 4 starsLovely tender beef, really good quality cuts, and flavorful sauce.* Pad Thai - 4 starsSoft noodles, tons of great veggies. Really good!|I had an excellent Saturday morning brunch here where I ordered the Chef's special (Khao Kha Moo -five spice pork shank with onion garlic, plum sugar in black soy sauce served with broccolini, half an egg, pickled veggies and white rice) and the whole young coconut. The food was great and having grown up in the Philippines, eating a young coconut never fails to evoke a little bit of my childhood.  The ambiance here is nice and festive but the restaurant can get a bit loud. Service is good and I recommend getting a reservation through yelp since this place gets really busy.  With tax and tip, this was about $40 - good value for money, in my humble opinion. The only complaint I have is that they have one single unisex bathroom and the wait can be long when they are busy.  Highly recommended!!!|I greatly enjoyed the casual, lively atmosphere with old Thai music playing in the background and the delicious food here. Ordered the following:Thai sausage appetizer - nicely seasoned and flavorfulPad see ew with chicken - the wide noodles were soft and had nice texture, the sauce was perfectFried chicken breast with roti, curry dipping sauce, and blue rice - chicken was crispy and flavorful and went well with the rice, roti dipped in the curry was delightful Everything I tried was delicious, and would definitely come back to try more items. The restaurant gets pretty packed, so make a reservation if you can.|Very good Thai place in the Mission area. Came by for a late lunch and most of their table were still full, must indicate their popularity :) We were seated pretty quickly (there is a person up front to check in with if there's a wait). They also do a lot of take out orders, so if you don't have time to dine in, that's also an option. They do take reservations, so if you have a decently sized party, it would be best to reserve. I hear they do fill up completely during peak hours. I've had the pad see you and pad spicy eggplant. The pad see you was pretty standard, good portion size, nothing super special. The eggplant was solid, not too salty or overly oily, though the flavors are pretty heavy. You can ask for mild spiciness too :D I got the eggplant with crispy pork belly, which was delicious. Each piece had some tenderness of the fatty part and then crispy in the lean parts. Good amount of pork belly for the extra $4 on top of the base dish price. Generally, their dishes have higher price tags than other other Thai places I've been too, but its decent for the food you get. Service was pretty good, though they were a bit curt when taking our order. All in all, I would recommend Farmhouse if you're feeling Thai in the Mission area. Pretty decently sized restaurant as well.|Been here for the first time and I was wowed by the ambience. The outside certainly does not ready you for what will it look like on the inside. I love the decorations and music they play throughout the night. We came here for a friends birthday and we were not disappointed. It's great that they also take reservation online which makes it easier for large parties (we were 6). There is parking around the area but it is scarce so I recommended perhaps the nearby parking garages if no street parking. The food was presented very beautifully and was just as delicious. I highly recommend telling the waiter if there is a birthday in your party, you definitely will not be disappointed ;)|After reading about this place on multiple food blogs and seeing the high rankings by my fellow Yelpers, I really wanted to like this place! I loved the lively environment, how engaged and fun loving the staff is, and the psychedelic decor, but the food was somewhat of a disappointment.First up, why can't we make reservations on the phone? I called up to get a table for two, and was told that there would be a 45 minute wait no matter when we reached. The only way to make a reservation was through the Yelp app, and no slots were available for this particular day. This makes it a little cumbersome to check out this place on a whim!We were turned off by the one hour plus wait when we got there, but were offered the choice of bar seating. Since it was just the two of us, and the bar has full service, we went with this option.The food menu is extensive, grouped into appetizers, curries, noodle dishes, street food, and entrees and each dish is clearly explained. Pictures would've been helpful, as most of the entrees come with multiple components. Spicy dishes are marked as such, and it would have been great to have crowd favorites/chef recommendations marked as well. The drinks menu is almost as extensive as the food menu, with a dozen cocktails, beers," and wines.We ordered the Hat Yai fried chicken meal and the """"Run Juan"""" sizzling seafood platter. We also got a Thai-chelada (Thai version of a michelada) and a Tsingha beer.The complimentary pickled salad that they serve before the food is so", so good! I finished the whole plate by myself and had to order for a second serving so that my dad could taste it as well.My order of the fried chicken came within 10 minutes, but my dad's order took much longer, and we had almost finished my entree by then.Hat Yai Fried Chicken - Southern Thai style fried chicken which comes with paratha, blue rice, yellow curry, pickled cucumbers, and a sweet ans spicy dipping sauce.The curry was really flavorful, and paired with the paratha would have made a perfectly adequate meal by itself. The blue rice was... well, blue. i couldn't detect any special flavor to it. The fried chicken was perfectly crisped, but was bland and a bit soggy on the inside, and no amount of the dipping sauce could remedy it. The portion was huge," and we struggled to finish it.""""Run Juan"""" sizzling seafood platter - The platter consisted of shrimp", calamari, scallops, and some sort of catfish in a spicy peppery sauce, with green and red peppers and onions, and came with a side of white rice. This dish was much better, and I could've licked the platter clean, had it not been a burn hazard. My dad and I agreed that we should've only ordered this entree and tried out one of the appetizers.The thai-chelada was eh. I ordered it because I've never had a michelada, so I didn't quite know what to expect, but it was sour and tangy and I was able to finish it, so I guess it was okay.At several points of time during dinner, the staff emerged from the kitchen with with raucous birthday chants, some sort of a hat for the birthday celebrator, and a cake of some sort (?). That looked like a lot of fun, so if I lived in SF, I'd definitely want to celebrate a birthday here.Service was attentive even though we were at the bar, and the bartender was very merry and chatty and made us feel like we were a part of the regular dining crowd.|Definitely a unique dining experience here.I came here for a birthday dinner and had a wonderful time. They make your birthday celebration real festive here. The food was also great and had a wide range of flavor and spices!A lot of their dishes are spicy so double check with a server to make sure what you are ordering ahead of time. My personal favorites include the Hat Yai Fried Chicken ($19) and Panang Neua ($25). The fried chicken was so crispy and juicy, it was unbelievable. Mix that with the curry and it was heaven! The braised short rib/ panang neua was also so perfect. The meat just falls right off the bone and getting a mix of the veggies made this dish a treat to eat. The blue rice was also a fun surprise, but it tastes like normal rice. I'd agree that the price point here is pretty pricey in my opinion with a lot of the entrees going for $15-$25, but the food does really speak for itself. Big big parties over 14 have a set menu and a price per head of around $50. So keep that in mind if you want to come here on your next big celebration :)|We were craving for Thai food around San Fran's is I area and seen this place through yelp they have a good ratings so we decided to try it.. place and ambience was felt the Thai vibe inside with their cool custome Muay Thai shorts and flower polo shirts lol. They were pretty busy when we came in. I didn't like the sittings and small tables  too small and the chair are hard to sit on. Food 5/5We ordered beef soup 24/7 it was so tasty and so good.. u can taste the sweetness and mix of fat and great flavors in it. Papaya salad was so good also it was mixed well. Pad see you was so flavorful also and for dessert Thai vacation that's coconut with coconut ice cream, and sticky rice so yummy . The price was a little pricey compare to other Thai reataurant but it's definitely worth it. Can't wait to go back for more and try other things they have to offer.Service 3/5They were too busy to see all the customers I guess and they put my dessert to go and I've been waiting for it for a while and by the time they realize they put it to go the ice cream melted already . They need to pay more attention even they are busy.. Ambiance/placeNeeds more improvement. I can see that they are busy. They prolly need the restaurant to be bigger and better chairs . On a Monday they are busy. Wow. All in all my rating is solid : 4  and we will come back for more food to try. Thanks|Okay, where do I start...First off, the service was unfortunately poor. The waiter had seated me (without greeting me) after leaving me hanging for about 10 mins at the door. Then, seated someone who came right after I did and seated the individual immediately and greeted him and took his order before me! Excuse me?! What is up with that. Am I an invisible Panda bear or something," geez... I used to serve plenty but c'mon it's common sense to go ahead and get the order and at least say """"hi."""" Second off", I was told to hurry up and rush my order because the kitchen was going to close/shut down (still had just about an hour before closing lunch) with an unpleasant attitude and tone of voice. I understand, the servers are probably having a bad day or just don't want to be there but you're at work suck it up and leave the issues and nasty attitudes at home because I'm coming to pay for a service and food...And lastly," the food...the food was good but not phenomenal or anything marvelous. The presentation was very pretty so I'll give credit for that. I ordered the """"Hat Yai Fried Chicken."""" It's just about $22.50. It comes with fried organic chicken breast", roti bread, blue jasmine ice and yellow potato curry. The chicken was very tasty and well cooked. The curry was a bit disappointing as the temperature was more on the cold/warm side and very salty. But everything else was good! I recommend you try it. Hopefully next time I come the service will improve and it will be better overall. I am willing to come give it another try.|Like Gus's market people come out of the woodwork that work in this area for this restaurant; it is definitely the place to go at the moment.  It can get super busy during lunch hour (probably dinner too but I've only been here for lunch) so I'd recommend a reservation or going closer to 1:30 because they close at 2pm for lunch.I'm very impressed with the visual presentation of all the dishes.  It all looks so colorful and thoughtfully put together making me want to take a picture of everthing (and I'm not one of those people that is always taking pictures of food).  Many of the alcoholic drinks are garnished with flowers, so pretty and presentable.I'd recommend the Hat Yai fried chicken.  It comes with roti bread, curry, and the ever famous blue rice.  Farmhouse is a little more on the pricey side, not that it's overpriced but you aren't going to find something here $10 for lunch.  For me it's more of a special occasion lunch than the regular meal but I like to come here because it's always a good experience.|Farmhouse has amazing food! I went there with a group of friends so I got to try quite a few different dishes. The ambiance is nice and the decor is really cute. For apps," we shared the Thai fish cakes and Ahi scoops. My friend and I shared the crab fried rice and pork belly pad see you.Everything was super good! I definitely recommend the crab fried rice. The side of bone broth is amazing."""
"Basil Thai Restaurant & Bar	""|This is one of the best Thai restaurants I have been to in a while in terms of food.We took the Yellow curry", pineapple fried rice and beef red curry. All the dishes were delicious.The best was the dessert, friend banana and ice cream.Good ambience too! Service could be slightly better.|The food was really good, ambience was nice, I'd give 5 stars for the food but unfortunately 2 stars for service. Thats a bummer.Location is great. The seats are not the most comfortable, but the food makes up for it. The portions are really big. We got the chicken yellow curry and pineapple fried rice.The fried banana ice cream was also really tasty, although I wish it came with an option of vanilla instead of coconut ice cream.Suggestion to owner: please work on the service and you'll find me coming back here!|Came here alone for a weekday lunch after getting fingerprinted at the store down the street. I was seated immediately at a small table and I ordered a Thai Tea and a veggie Pad See Ew (My go-to for Thai restaurants). The waitress asked if I would like it with coconut cream and I said yes because - why not? I've never had my Thai tea served with coconut cream before. It was interesting. I'm not sure if I would want my Thai tea that way all the time but I didn't hate it and once in a while owuld be nice.It took a bit for my Pad See Ew to arrive, but when it arrived, it didn't disappoint. It was saucy and the noodles were soft. There were an array of vegetables. I would definitely come back and try the other dishes. Solid Thai place if I were ever in SOMA again.|Been here a couple times now and while my first experience didn't live up the hype the second one was solid. I came here with a friend who always came for here dinner and not lunch. He found out quick that their dinner and lunch menus were very different. I had even looked over their menu online to see what they served but it really was nothing like what we were handed when we sat down.My friend ordered the Spicy Basil w/Chicken and I went with the Sweet and Sour Lover w/ Chicken. We also decided to go with the Chicken Fried Rice instead of the normal steamed rice. While my food was decent, he wasn't much of a fan of his. I think that had alot to do with his expectation of it being similar to the dinner dish he normally orders, unfortunately for him it wasn't the case. The fried rice was also ok. Overall, everything really lacked spice for me, from the soup to the fried rice nothing had any sort for spice or seasoning. With that said I would like to come back because I feel that if I tell them to spice my order up it would make a huge difference. Will be back one day.|We waited at the table for 10 plus minutes and nobody came to take our order.  The server that we summoned was really confused and asked whether someone had taken our order.  Upon learning about the wait time," she simply said """"let's do it now"""" and took the order in vexation.  She ended up forgetting one of the drinks and we had to place another order in with another guy", who also failed to place the order.Shrimp chips:  complimentary app from the restaurant.  Wish the waiter could have told us that after dumping it off at the table and took off without saying anything.Papaya salad:  solid.  Tart and spicy.  Strong flavors of fish sauce and lime.  Stuffed eggplant with green curry:  interesting idea wrapping minced chicken with eggplant.  Texture's interesting and all but nothing special in terms of flavor as chicken was somewhat tasteless.  Green curry however was well balanced in terms of sweetness and savoriness.  Not too heavy nor too sweet.Pad Ke-moo:  the spicy wide noodles lacked the heat as promised in the title. The skirt steak slices felt like they were boiled in water dumping into the plate with the rest of the greens and noodles.  After receiving the check, from the same girl that placed the order earlier," a credit card was placed in the plastic card slot.  Another ten minutes went by before we got her attention and she looked at us confused and frozen solid like a deer staring at the headlights of a vehicle.  Took her a minute or two before figuring out what she missed.  Opened the plastic folder and looked back at us saying """"So.... you done?"""".|Had dinner here tonight as a party of four. A waitress tripped and spilled sauce all over my dry clean only shirt. Totally understand that things happen by accident - but there was no action taken by the restaurant to remedy this. Very disappointed in the level of service after such an incident. I think that the very least the could have done was comp my dish", provide a free dessert - literally anything to have made me feel better about the situation. Won't be coming back.|Came here for dinner to celebrate a girlfriends birthday.We were seated at a large table in the back of the restaurant. The food was ordered before I arrived but I tried the pumpkin curry and pad thai. Very good, but honestly, I think it's hard to mess up pad thai.I really like the ambiance and environment, perfect for a date night or a group gathering.|Yum. Food was excellent. Could have done without the PDA from the cop from YMCA and his husband, but I'm sure they're not there all the time. It is San Francisco, but c'mon fellas, you're in public. Leather and PDA are fine in moderation, leave the heavy petting for private time. Not appropriate. Food probably would be acceptable for second tasting, but thankfully we were satiated and left before the fellas made us ill. Food was awesome. Heavy PDA, gay or straight, not awesome.|Came here on Friday night after some natural wine at Terroir (love). It was completely packed/ honestly a little hectic with how the hostess was noting parties. I had little confidence she would remember us/ seating was a little Wild Wild West for my liking. This could have also been to my hangry state (to everyone's dismay). We ended up spotting some seats at the bar and quickly pulled up seats. Side note, the bartender did not acknowledge us for at least 10 minutes (but it felt like 30, again, hangry).We eventually put in food orders and moods were improved all around. We had some mild food allergies (peanuts and bell peppers) among the group and I was pleasantly surprised how easily they accommodated this/ were able to remove from our dishes of choice (even more impressed Bc this meant things were being prepped to order). Meal was good, my favorites were the fresh rolls and eggplant and shiitake dish. Would pass on the coconut braised pork shoulder curry which was a bit disappointing, I found the meat tough. All in all, probably would not go out of my way to return, but if you find yourself in the area this is a solid choice for elevated Thai. Trendy atmosphere and full bar are an added bonus.|This is a trendy Thai restaurant that would be a good venue for a casual date or meet up with a few friends. The food and drinks are definitely higher quality and the flavors are on point. That being said, it is a bit on the pricey end for what it is. Granted this is SF but having spent so much time in Southeast Asia, it is hard to wrap my head around the enormous difference in price.Despite the price, I have been to Basil twice already mainly due to the authenticity of flavors. Thai food in the United States tends to be towards the sweeter side while actual Thai food is a combination of tart, fresh, spicy and savory. I think Basil delivers on this well.|The pad Thai and mojito were very good! I get pad Thai often and this one is up there in top pad Thais I've had. The pan fried potstickers were way too fried, bf and I didn't eat them. We often order the same thing elsewhere and never had it so fried. He said his chicken cashew nut stir fry was alright.  Slow service but that's ok. Relatively full of patrons on Tuesday night, but no need to wait for a table. Decently zen ambience with low, chill tunes.|Every Thai restaurant I go to, I get exceptional service and Basil Thai is no exception. The servers are very attentive and the restaurant itself has a nice, calm atmosphere. My friend and I got the mild chicken curry with potatoes as well as the spicy pad see ew (not sure if I spelled that right). The noodles were flavorful and not too oily. As for the curry, I would have wished the potatoes were cooked a little longer (not enough moosh to them). Overall, I enjoyed my meal! Portions are large so don't order too much~*PS: They have brown rice|My friend and I decided to come here due to the great reviews and the proximity Civic Center bart. From the moment we walked in, we could tell this was a cute date spot! there were candles in the middle of each table. The menu is super diverse, and it has most of the items you'd see in any other Thai Place. The reason for my 4 start instead of 5, is that I thought our food wasn't cooked thoroughly. My vegetables were fresh, but pretty hard I have to admit :( Other than that, the service was good, and the food was pretty good! I would recommend.|Popular restaurant during lunch hour and it can get pretty loud. Had the squid salad for $13.95 -- squid was pretty tasty, didn't taste frozen. Salad felt very clean and light -- good item if you're trying to order something healthy for lunch. Wait staff also try to be attentive. A little pricey overall but maybe for the area, this is standard. Parking can be slightly challenging, especially with all the one way streets and left hand metered parking. The overall area is about 3 grimacing faces:|Came here with a friend last month when I was in the city, after a long day walking around town and seeing the sights. We were excited to try it, as my friend had had it bookmarked for a while, and we were absolutely not disappointed!Usually when I go to Thai places I end up defaulting to either the pad thai or the pad see ew, but I'm really happy that we tried some of the less common entrees because they were both delicious. The praram rong song (grilled marinated skirt steak with house curried-peanut sauce and steamed vegetables) was tender and delicious, especially with the peanut sauce, and the kang gari gai (slow-cook 1/2 chicken, onions, & potatoes in mild yellow curry) was fall off the bone delicious and perfect after a chilly December day in San Francisco.Dinner prices are extremely reasonable, especially considering we had enough of each entree to take home for leftovers. Service was excellent and the inside of the place is small but elegant. Would love to come back here again the next time I'm in the city.|Great meal. They have these yummy, crispy chips they give you as an appetizer that we couldn't get enough of. We had a big party so ordered across the menu - soup, chow mein and chow fun, seafood dishes, beef dishes and curry dishes, and we devoured it all. The food was really tasty, not too spicy, and the ambiance was enjoyable. The wait staff had a hard time understanding simple things like hot sauce, jalapeno in vinegar (they brought us a spoon), but other than that, all good and very delicious. I would definitely come again!|Shared a couple dishes with the coworkers for dinner tonight! We got the radish cakes, corn fritters, pumpkin pork red curry, and fried catfish. My overall impressions were that the food was on the oily side (this is perhaps we ordered fried things only) and that the herbs they used stood out compared to other Thai spots I've been to.The radish cakes were basically like Chinese ones, except without the mushroom and sausage that are in the Chinese version. I didn't like that they were so fried, but my coworkers did. A 3/5 for me.The corn fritters may not have been as crunchy as they could have since we got delivery. They were floury and the corn was more broken up. Tasty, but not too memorable.The pumpkin pork red curry had a strong coconut base. The pork was of the solid variety, but fell apart easily when poked with a fork. The pumpkin could have been a bit more soft. A 3.5/5 on this.The catfish was also breaded and fried, but felt too covered in breadcrumbs for my liking. Good flavor though. The eggplant in the dish was cooked well. A 3.3/5 for this. Overall, a solid 3.3 for me! It wasn't the taste that was missing as much as the oiliness / fried-ness. I would come back to try less fried dishes!|Good place for big parties, but not authentic Thai food. I dined here for a friends birthday. We had to a set menu - two appetizers, 5 entrees, and one dessert. Portions were small (there wasn't enough chicken satay for everyone). $25/person plus tax and tip, expensive for the amount of food I ate. Ambiance was quiet and nice. There's a bar up front for some alcohol if you so choose.|Ordered the Pad Kee Mao from here as part of a Postmates order and it was decent. It came with beef and there were a variety of vegetables. The noodles were mostly pretty well cooked too, there weren't any overly broken pieces.The drawback was that it needed a little bit more spiciness, the beef was kind of dry in some parts, and I feel I have had better for the price.A few notes though," they forgot to provide any utensils with the order which kind of sucked.|Fabulous tom kha soup and beef curry. very fast for take out orders. but can be a bit crowded to eat-in and a bit of a wait. However the service is solid and very professional and polite.Part of me wishes this place redesigned to be more of a 'date' spot. Part of me wishes it did post-bars take-out food. Part of me wishes it had more tables for large groups. but being right in the middle of these in SoMa seems to work well for Basil Thai.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Blackwood	""|This restaurant is simply amazing!!! From the super friendly staff to the delicious food", man I wish I would've found this place sooner. It was the perfect place for all my brunch desires! Between 3 people, we decided to share:The Kai Gata with Rainbow PotatoesThe One Percenter's Burger (w/ Millionaire's Bacon)The Crispy French ToastTwo things I absolutely love: Brunch. And Thai Food. I have been dying to go back and try all of the other menu options that caught my eye. I definitely will be back soon!Tip: Check in to reserve your place in line to skip the wait! We put our name on the list an hour ahead and got there right in time to be seated. Major save!|I came here for Friday lunch and left a happy camper... after reading other reviews, I definitely want to come back for brunch.Here's what I liked:Quick food prep + delicious flavors:  All of our food came out in 10 minutes after ordering.  I had the green curry with tofu.  The portions were huge, and it came with a ton of veggies... I ended up having to take half of it home.  The flavor of the curry was on the sweeter side, which suited me just fine.  Friendly service: They were on top of re-filling the water in an unobtrusive mannerGreat space with very very high ceilings: Always a fan of that architectural feature because it makes the room feel light and airyReasonable prices|Here with a party of 6 for a birthday brunch on a Saturday ~1pm! There were 30 tables before us but the line moved up pretty quick!  We got a table about an hour later.  Their foods look very aesthetic but taste slightly above average American brunch. Personally I like their crusty French toast the most but it is kind of in small portion. Nice interior and quick service! Our order is served within 10 minutes! They did not give us any dirty look even though we stayed for a while after we finished our food! I also have to recognize their excellent customer service! We asked a waiter to store our cake in their fridge but as we were on our way to head out they brought the cake out and all the staffs sang us a birthday song. Very thoughtful of them :P Con: This district is not as parking friendly. We spent a while to look for parkings.  Their music is very loud indoor! It is difficult to talk to friends :( Tips: book a reservation on yelp waitlist!! I assume it is always busy here on the weekend|Delicious food! Came here on a whim meeting a friend for lunch in the city. Didn't realize it was in a cute strip of restaurants on Chestnut street. Higher priced food for lunch, but very worth it.You will enjoy!|Recently had a boozy brunch here this past Saturday...my favorite types of brunches.Wait Time:Arrived at 12:30 PM and put our names down for 3 on a Saturday. Quoted us for an hour, though I was a little skeptical since there were about 30ish names ahead of us. But since Chestnut street has a lot cute shops, figured I'd kill time and an hour wouldn't be too bad...We were sat at 2:15 PM. Alright, my only recommendation, better quote times please! Service & Food: So if you've read my past raving review of Sweet Maple (in Pac Heights), you know I am a huge fan of that place... discovered that they have the same owners as Blackwood!! This is explains some overlap in menu items and prices. Both places do a great job in incorporating fusion into traditional American breakfast.Blackwood has the traditional brunch staples (eggs, Benedict's, waffles, sweet items) but they have good selection of Thai staples as well. I ordered the Panang Curry w/Tofu. Friends ordered the Hot Stone Pot and the Burger. AND OF COURSE, we ordered the bottomless mimosss. $22 per person for 90 minutes. The Stone Pot is definitely one of their more popular dishes, definitely ordering that next time (I tried it and it was amazing). Overall, very pleased with my experience here. I'll definitely be returning. I'm interested to try their dinner here.|I've been wanting to try this asian-fusion brunch spot for a while, and I was luckily able to come for a brunch date with a girl friend. It is located in a very cute, quaint part of San Francisco in the Marina district, and there are plenty of boutiques and coffee shops around the area. We were able to find parking pretty quickly at a nearby parking lot, with $3/hr parking. However, the wait was absolutely ridiculous! For two people, we waited for about two hours. They also do not take reservations, so be prepared for a line if you decide to try this place on the weekend. Once we were finally seated, I decided on the millionaires bacon benedict and my friend ordered the two egg breakfast. I really wanted to try this bacon hype, and I wasn't disappointed! I am not a bacon fan, but the sweet-savory aroma of the millionaires bacon was delicious. My eggs were also perfectly poached and the crispy, rainbow potatoes were also delicious. The portions are pretty big here as well, but enough for one meal or a small to-go box. The guests next to us were having the stone pot breakfast, and it smelled amazing! I see it being a popular item on the menu, and would probably like to try that next time.This is a nice area and beautiful place for brunch, but the wait differently keeps me from wanting to come often. Otherwise, a great spot for brunch!|Packed with flavor and gorgeously plated Blackwood was a treat for the senses. each dish that was prepared was so fragrant and unique it was honestly hard to select a favorite by the end of the night. The decor was fab, the ambience great, my only real complaint was that the drinks were on the weak side... but the food made up for the fact.Appetizers:The million-dollar bacon is exactly that candy-coated in sticky maple goodness and served over crisp asparagus. The mushroom egg rolls were on par with some of my favorite Thai spring rolls I've ever had... they were extra crispy and packed with glass noodles. The samosas where unlike any that I've tried before; savory and soft. The Marina Tower is a ceviche lover's dream, and the touch of mango was a surprising twist.Mains:After debating over the menu for what seemed like an eternity,"  I settled on one of the """"Thai street food dishes"""". I ended up going with the Thai Ginger prawns and the seaweed salad on the side. The prawns stole the show! The dish was not overburdened by any starches or heavy sauces... the true flavors shone through along with the vegetable assortment and perfect ginger heat. The seaweed salad was amazing and a surprisingly large portion than is normally served elsewhere.|A couple friends and I stopped in for Brunch this past Saturday for some bites and bottomless mimosas ($22)Here's our order:Millionaires Bacon: The balance of sweet and savory make this a must have for any bacon lover. Thick and just right amount of crispy. If you've had millionaires bacon other places", it taste about the same. Hard to mess this one upLoco Benny: The waygu patty made this dish. Filled with tons of flavor, poached egg cooked perfect, and with a hollandaise sauce that has a little bit of nice kick too it. It comes with their potatoes, which was probably the best I've ever had. Nice crunch with a soft inside, the medley of potatoes gives it different layers of flavor HotStone Pot Fried Rice w/Chicken Mango Sausage: The presentation of this dish is amazing. It comes out in a huge stone pot and they mix the rice at your table. The flavor however was just alright. I've had a lot of fried rice in my day and this was about average. This is a good dish to share, that way you can try more.Wait time: We were able to get our name on the list via Yelp before coming to the restaurant. Total wait time was around 1hr. Big crowds and long lines, expected on a Saturday, but their food comes out quick and the mimosas have a 90-minute limit.Overall: great food and ambiance makes this place a great go-to for brunch. I'll definitely be returning to this establishment!|Everything here is so freaking delicious! I legit want to try everything on their menu since everything I've tried so far was not disappointing. The place has such a great location with.high ceilings. Their menu is somewhat large but maybe because it's overwhelming how many food items sound perfect all at once. We ordered a fried rice dish that seams like their most popular dish, along with an egg Benny and savory shrimp pancake. The savory pancake happened to be my favorite. I can't wait to com back and try more items soon!|I've been here a good handful of times now and everytime I go, I find something new that's really good. All the people I come with also thoroughly enjoy this place as well. I've had the hot stone pot, the loco moco benny, french toast, lemon ricotta stack, millionaire's bacon, etc and everything is so good. I've only been for Sunday brunch so I can't say anything about dinner (definitely want to try them for dinner sometime, though).First things first, the parking is street or there's a garage around the corner. The wait can be pretty long at times but you can conveniently get on the wait list remotely through Yelp.Keeping this review short since I only have good things to say about this place. Definitely recommend!|Overview: Blackwood is a small-medium, Thai-fusion restaurant with classy décor, bold flavors, careful presentation, options for large groups, and a huge variety of menu options including alcoholic drinks. They serve brunch, lunch, and dinner and while I have only been here for dinner, It was a spectacular experience marred only by a few lackluster entrees.The Establishment: Located in the Marina district on Chestnut street (just east of Pierce), it is much classier than I expected for a Thai restaurant with very tall ceilings, muted colors, large mirrors, and plush seating. Options for outdoor seating as well.The Service: Much more down-to-earth than the décor," and about """"average"""" level attentive. They were very kind in seating our large group before everyone had arrived and handled all of our requests with a smile.The Food: The appetizers here were hands down some of the best that I have had here in San Francisco from their presentation to the flavor profile. The pricing was also reasonable ($10-14). I also ordered the raspberry lemonade which I thought was delightful and refreshing though perhaps a bit too sugary for my tastes. Below are highlights:Millionaire's Way: 4 stars. Millionaire's Bacon (which is thick-cut bacon cooked in sugar and pepper) served on asparagus. Sugar", protein, fat to the max. So good.Ahi Scoops: 5 stars. Ahi tuna plated on a bed of greens (cucumber, seaweed, and wasabi sauce. Perfect. I could eat 20 of these and still want more. Soft, savory, crunchy, sour... I'm drooling just writing about it.Five Spice Belly: 4.5 stars. Wonderfully savory pork belly cooked just right served on a bed of arugula. Crispy Crusted Tiger Prawns: 4.5 stars. Wow. You put deep fried shrimp on spinach, ginger, coconut, and onions and it tastes even better.Deep Fried Seafood Sampler (I forgot the name): 4 stars. Who doesn't like deep fried calamari, shrimp, and fish!? The entrees (priced around $22-26) were the only reason why Blackwood narrowly missed the 5-star mark for me.Braised Beef Rib: 4 stars. Very cool presentation served on a blackened bone. While tender and well seasoned, I felt that they could have improved upon both the texture and the moistness.King Salmon: 2 stars. Overcooked, and lacking in any good infused flavors. The bed of bell peppers and asparagus didn't save it.Panag Curry: 3.5 stars. The chicken was a bit dry but the sauces saved it.The desserts were also wonderful and priced at about $9-12:Granny In Town: 4.5 stars. Crispy French toast, caramelized banana, vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce. Bread Pudding: 4.5 stars. Gelato and sweet bread. Gosh darn it was amazing.Conclusions: Blackwood exceeded my expectations in so many ways from the comfort and classiness of the restaurant, the bold flavors and creative presentation of the food, and the variety of items they offered. If the entrees had been as spectacular as the appetizers, I would easily have given Blackwood 5-stars.|Brunch & Thai food, a combination I haven't tried before. Honestly the best Thai food I have ever  had!! It was a chilly day in SF and I was looking for some thing warm and the red curry hit that perfect spot. It had a spicy kick which was perfect. They have bottomless brunch options as well, so if you're going with a group, highly recommend. It's a tiny place & gets very busy so I would definitely make a reservation beforehand. Honestly their menu is expansive and everything sounds really good. Can't wait to come back & try som more of the options. Tldr: A perfect brunch/lunch spot, If you're visiting SF definitely a must try!!!!!|We're back in the Marina, this time for good since we're proud homeowners (so much adulting).Hands down the best thing that has changed about Blackwood is the waitlist feature! Blackwood has gotten even more popular with crowds on the sidewalk, so the waitlist feature is pretty essential now. Grab your virtual spot on the iPad outside, or better yet, from your phone at home, and enjoy your free time. I did it while getting ready and timed it so I could stroll on in to meet my friend and grab our table.The menu's a bit different but my favorites are still rolling hard. The lemon ricotta pancakes were just as wonderful and decadent as I remembered. Along with Plow's (which are very different - smaller and thicker), they're my favorite pancakes in the city, and essentially of any city for that matter. I'm still all about the savory balance with the side of rainbow potatoes. The service was nicer and more attentive than I remembered, even on a typically busy brunch rush. I'm sure we'll be back for dinner soon and already have a large-party brunch planned.On a personal note, I'm glad to say I graduated (abandoned) the Splenda habit present during my last review. Good coffee doesn't need sweeteners.|My friends and I had brunch here and it was pretty good. There was a short wait around 11:00, but it wasn't all that bad compared to other brunch places I've had to wait for.The place has that same style as Kitchen Story, a bit of an Asian take on brunch food. I didn't actually quite enjoy it as much but it still was really good.My friends and I shared a blackberry mojito and it was okay. It was a bit sweeter than I would normally like," but it was still decently strong and not all that bad.I had the stone pot """"brunch"""" bibimbap with shrimp and it was decently good", but not as amazing as say, the one at Surisan. Overall a good choice and still pretty good.|After a friend recommended Blackwood to me we excited to try it out after we looked over what seemed to be an extremely diverse menu. We walked in without a reservation around 1:45 PM on a Thursday and were seated immediately. It was't as packed as I assumed it would be but regardless it still seemed busy enough to warrant its popularity.We were a party of three and we were seated inside towards the right side of the restaurant. The space itself is really minimally decorated and is also adorned with large windows which lets in tons of natural light. The restaurant says it's a take on asian fusion, so when it came time to order I decided to go with the Pad Kee Mow ($15) with a choice of meat (I choose chicken). Overall a really hearty dish. I left both full and satisfied after finishing the entire plate. It came with a spicy flat rice noodle and bamboo shoots along with a ton of other really tasty ingredients!The service at this spot was really great as well. Our server was extremely attentive throughout our time here and answered the questions we had about a few of the dishes on the menu.Overall a great spot to stop in for a causal lunch with friends or family. I didn't seem busy while we were there, but I assume it probably gets packed during the more hectic times throughout the week.|Our family had dinner here tonight, and it was great. Blackwood is an Asian fusion restaurant with an emphasis on Thai food. We started with a delicious fried shrimp appetizer perched on top of a spinach leaf with small bits of crunchy sesame seed and special sauce. Then on to the dinner. We had Penang curry chicken, pad see you, a stirfry seafood medley called tsunami, and roasted pork on top of rice. All were excellent. But the Penang curry was slightly bland and lacked kaffur lime leaves. We finished with fried ice cream and mango sticky rice.|I've had Blackwood bookmarked for a while now and I was so excited to finally give it a try! Came here with two friends for a late brunch on a Sunday afternoon and were seated immediately. The restaurant is pretty small and cozy but the very high ceiling makes it feel more spacious than it actually is. Also heads up: it can get pretty noisy," if that bothers you For an appetizer we got the marina strips and BW pajun. The strips were pricey for only getting four imo...but were definitely very tasty. The pajun was ok. It isn't crispy and doesn't have the same flavor profile compared to the """"traditional"""" pajun you'd get at a Korean restaurant. But I mean this place isn't Korean so no surprise there. For our mains", we got the Dungeness omelet and deep fried french toast. The omelet was good (I'd give it a 7/10) and served with some of the best potatoes ever. The deep fried french toast was my favorite! It wasn't too sweet and because it was deep fried, the taste really reminded me of funnel cake. They also garnished it with the sweetest berries ever.I also got myself a melon mule and it was so yummy! I'm not a huge drinker but I loved it. Service was very friendly attentive. Be sure to give Blackwood a try if you're in the area!!|Went for lunch, we ordered the samosas and the ahi scoops! OMG the ahi scoops were amazing! Somosas were pretty good too! For our entrees, the Thai ginger tofu, green curry and yellow curry all were exceptional! The only thing is that service is a little slow... not enough to complain about but not as attentive as they should be! This is a must we even thought of eating there 2 days in a row!|Millionaire's bacon. Tried to recreate it. Couldn't. Keep going back for more. Located in the heart of the Marina district, this popular brunch place usually has a line out the door on weekends. It's a sister restaurant to Sweet Maple, so expect to see some familiar items on the menu, like millionaire's bacon (see above).   One of my favorites to take people from out of town because the environment is fun, the wait staff and friendly and attentive, the drinks are good (my girlfriend loves their lattes), and the food is incredible. Favorites- stone pot- BW scramble- beef rib- potatoes - they come with egg dish breakfasts and are incredible- chicken satay- salmon entree- latte- jam that comes on the table with breakfast|I always have my RBF (resting brunch face) ready! I am constantly looking for new brunch spots to check out! Honestly, brunch is the best meal for me. I saw a lot of posts of Blackwood on Instagram and then when I saw there was reservations available on Yelp for the time I wanted, I decided to check it out! I am so glad that I did. It's a nice spot with plenty of street parking nearby. There is outdoor and indoor seating. The outdoor seating has heaters so don't worry about being cold if you're sitting outside. Okay, now onto the important stuff the FOOD! So, I am NOT a huge fan of Pork Belly at all. The 48 hour Blackhawk Belly made from Kurobuta Pork has changed my mind completely! Omg, it literally melts in your mouth it was amazing and filled with so much flavor! I highly recommend it," the broccolini and the turmeric rice that comes with it is a perfect pairing as well. I also tried the 24 hour beef noodle soup so much flavor in the broth. The red sangria is great also! It is a bit on the pricey side but def worth it! The service is great as well.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"House of Thai	""|True rating: 4.5Here's the breakdown:1. The neighborhood is a little sketchy but the restaurant itself is nicely decorated and spacious2. The food is tasty but truly depends on what you get. I personally got a soup based dish with fish (I forgot the name :c). It tasted like homemade food back in South Korea", which was great and heart warming. My friend got a vegetarian stir fry which tasted like a typically Chinese/Thai restaurant stir fry. So the taste really depends on what dish you get.3. The interior is nice. Nicely lit and cozy yet modern. The bathroom is located upstairs where you have to take the stairs to get up there. So not immobile friendly. 4. The service is okay. They are not rude but I didn't sense the extra effort to be warm and friendly with the customers. It also took a really long time to get the waitress attention at one point. 5. The prices are reasonable. They are not overly expensive or extremely cheap. I think the prices are fair for what they provide. Overall, I would recommend this place to someone who is looking for a place to eat in the area. I don't think this is the 'go-to' spot for someone who is visiting SF, but I would go again. I really did like their soup based dish with fish.|This is hands down the best Thai food I've had in SF. I wish I could give 6 stars! I've ordered from this place dozens of times and not once was I let down. It's hard to pick favorites, but I'd absolutely recommend any of their curry dishes (Gang Ga-Ree Gai and Pad Pong-Ga-Ree are especially good), Pad Gra-Praw, the beef jerky, Chan Pad Poo (stick noodles with crab), and taro ball soup for dessert.Also, kudos for never arriving late or mixing up any of my delivery orders.|Ordered take out from here after another place (closer by) could not take our order even though their hours were listed as open until midnight. The Pad Gra-Praw was pretty good, though a bit more vegetable would have been preferred. The spice level was decent, considering I ordered medium spicy," and the vegetable rolls were good. The take out receipt showed our name as """"at"""" which was definitely not correct", and had our phone number wrong (so if there was an issue, it would not get fixed). This was bothersome since the employee repeated the name and number back to me. Overall it was a good experience and I would try them again.|Tasty Thai food in San Francisco near the Orpheum theatre. Good place to catch a bite before a show and then stop by philz nearby for a caffeine fix. Hub and I ordered pad ke mau which is drunken noodles, steak salad, green beans n pork belly and for dessert Roti. Food was fresh and delicious, service was nice as well. A great experience and I didn't feel drowsy afterwards which means little to none msg|We went here on Pride weekend on a Sunday around 7:10pm. Communication: 2/5 starsA worker inside asked us for our name, wrote it down along with some other people's names for the people around us and quoted us a time of 10-20 min and asked us if we wanted a menu so we could look at it while waiting. After looking at it for a while, my friend and I chose our items and continued to wait a little. I then noticed that another lady worker started asking the people around us for the name of their party. She then came up to us and asked you if we were waiting for our food. I told her no, we were waiting to be seated and the other lady got our names already.This showed me that there's a clear disconnect between workers because she didn't appear to know that we were waiting to be seated, even though someone already got our names like 15 min ago. She even seated some people that came after us... This kind of irked me since I'm thinking- why did that other lady get our name then?? Luckily, they had a table free so we didn't have to wait any longer...Food: 4/5 starsWe ordered 3 items. Now, just to get a heads up, I like Thai food," but I'm very weak against spicy food so I tend to get stuff that's not really spicy at all. We decided on three items.Salad Neur Sun $13: 4/5 starsTender beef put on top of a """"salad"""" composed of lettuce", 3 slices of tomato on the side, and raw onions with some type of special sweet salad dressing/glaze. You kind of have to mix up the salad, since parts of the lettuce doesn't have any dressing on it. The beef was very tender," and the glaze in the """"salad"""" was pretty sweet and tasty.Pad Kee Mao with beef $11: 4/5 starsSince I'm weak against spice", I asked if we could make this mild spice level and the server said it was OK. This tasted like a spicier version of Pad See Yew. Now, I really like Pad See Yew, so I really liked this dish as well, although their mild spice level is still pretty damn spicy to me. If I were to order this again, I would make sure to say I wanted no spice. However, the beef in this was pretty dry, and was definitely of lower quality than the beef in the above-mentioned salad.Gang Dang with pork $13 a la carte: 4/5 starsThis is basically like panang curry but the sauce is definitely more watery. I also chose to have mild spice level and this was also a bit too spicy for me. We ordered a side of Jasmine rice for $2, because you can't get curry without rice. They also gave a smaller version over rice for $11, but I wanted the full size. This also tasted yummy, although spicy. The pork was also too dry.Service: 3.5/5 starsThere was a male server that went around refilling people's water, but when I wanted water due to the spice level, he was nowhere to be seen. The other servers were also a bit less attentive. We called one server for water, but she never came back. When we asked for a check and a box, we got those pretty quickly. We didn't have to wait too long the food to be served. I didn't use their restroom so I'm not sure how clean it was...Would I come again? Yes, if I'm in the neighborhood, but maybe I'll try dishes with tofu or chicken to see if it's better with those options instead...|Delivery took an hour.  Resto was one mile from my hotel.  The amount of food was teenie weenie for the price. I ordered Tom yum soup but got something else.  Food was just ok, nothing special.|I love the food at this place. Good quantity and presentation. I will also say that the food delivery time is always faster than what the Yelp estimates. I recommend the Pumpkin Curry with brown rice!!|Came here for my graduation lunch after the ceremony and they were so accommodating for a large party of 14. Open spacious seating with lots of light. It's in a sketchy area but it's safe enough during the daytime. Coordinating for reservations on the phone was an easy task. Was even able to pre-order ahead of time so that the food was quick to come out after we got seated. I would highly recommend this place for large parties/group dinners. All the food was delicious with few things I would change. Tom yum soup -- more sour than most, but still very good! (4/5)Calamari -- not skimpy or too oily (5/5)Pad Thai -- basic Thai food noodle staple. Yes!!!! (5/5)Pad kee mao -- basic Thai food noodle staple (5/5)Fried catfish with plum sauce -- unique take and executed well! (4/5)Steak strips with salad -- (4/5)Pineapple fried rice -- not the most outstanding but good and filling (4/5)I'm glad I found this place and would come back if I'm in the area again for some delicious Thai food.|Located in the heart of San Francisco, House of Thai bring together the flavors of Thai and the presentation of any local big city dish. Atmosphere - Inside there is a normal amount of seating and tables for guests to enjoy their meal. Their bathroom is located up the stairs and is a little bit cramped-- the stairs going up are a little bit small and cramped as well so be sure to take your time. The restaurant space is wide and open which can make the noise level a little high during certain times, but we were still able to enjoy our meal and conversation regardless of the noise around us.   Food - I had the Pad Thai (Pictured) and it was delicious! I love the Thai peanut sauce they use along with the pan-fried rice, stick noodles with shrimps, egg, fresh tofu, green onions, beans, sprouts, and ground peanuts. All in all it made for an amazing Pad Thai dish and not too spicy because I got moderate. Service - I would've given this place a 4/5, but their service was very very very slow... We were sitting there for a long time before someone actually came and took our order, got us more water, gave us a receipt, or even checked up on how we were doing. The restaurant wasn't even full or busy at the time, they just wanted to take their time in serving us. Most of the time I saw servers just hanging around near the kitchen and talking rather than serving tables. It was a good first experience going there, but I don't think I'd want to go back... Too slow of a service for my taste.|Recently tried their delivery option. Food was well-packed, with no leaks. The noodles were a bit drier than when consumed at the restaurant. The fried rice tasted fine. When ordering via Uber Eats, however," the drivers have occasionally asked that you come down to the car as """"they can't find parking.""""Previous review:Thought it was a bit touristy from the outside", but the food is actually not too bad. Would steer clear of the soup we ordered that was a bit too sour and sweet for my taste. The rest of the dishes aren't bad. They have some choices for alcoholic beverages.|What's the perfect meal on a cold day?  Soup.  My friend suggested this place specifically for their noodle soup.  Alright, I'm not even going to bother looking at the menu; you order while I run to the restroom.  Cool.Tom Yum Noodle Soup - To my surprise, this was a noodle dish and not just a bowl of soup!  The soup alone is worth slurping every last bit.  The noodles were endless. The flavor was phenomenal.  As full as I was, this dish was worth losing a button from my jeans.  Delicious.Friendly staff, good food|I came back for a second time and decided to get the #61 tom yum noodle soup. My friend got that last time, so I wanted to experience the goodness for myself. It looks like I always end up liking the dish my eating buddy orders. My friend got the #57 sukiyaki stir fry noodles, and it was DELICIOUS! She couldn't talk for about 10 minutes because she was having an out-of-world-when-Harry-met-Sally-esque experience. That sesame-bean curd sauce is something else. Wow. HOT is legit. I will come back here again and again.|Best thing about this place is that it is open late for San Francisco. The service is a bit slow and not attentive. The restaurant is clean. The food is average.We ordered the Tom Yum soup and the Pad Thai. I would not go back there unless I was starving at 10PM in SF.|Stumbled upon this place when we were in the area. The restaurant we originally wanted to go to was closed, but this was right across the street so it turned out to be an happy accident since we had a good experience. We ordered tofu pad thai, pork pad gra-praw, and gang dang. The pad thai was the favorite of everybody. It was saucey which was how I like it. Ask for a spice rack if you don't think it's spicy enough. The pad gra-praw was a good level of spice however I wished there was more vegetables. We finished the rice that came with it pretty quickly so it was difficult just eating that pork all on its own. The gang dang (red curry) was delicious as well. Portions were reasonable, prices felt a bit more expensive than your average thai restaurant but it made sense considering this is in the heart of SF. This was a good way to end our SF trip and definitely satisfied our thai cravings.|We really wanted Thai food and found this place on Yelp. We ordered the Tom Kha Chicken (spicy coconut milk soup with lemongrass, galangal, Kaffir lime leaves, and mushrooms) and Pad Thai with beef. We also ordered Thai tea.The Thai tea here is solid in taste. Enough sweetness and flavor of the Thai leaves.The Pad Thai is flavorful and portions are fine. I've had plenty of similar pad thai elsewhere so didn't think it was special.The soup was definitely sour enough but was missing the spicy element. My biggest problem is with the overcooked chicken. It was tough and bland. I think this place has solid food.|Located fairly close to where I go to the gym. I was recommended this location by one of the guys at gym since it opens up late.It's not the best place for thai food but it suffices. I ordered a pork pad thai and something else I forgot. However they both tasted very plain and wasn't really that special overall. Would recommend that they use more sauces to make the flavors better and more unique.Probably the best thing about this place is that it closes late.|This is for takeout only. We ordered pad kee mao, eggplant with chicken, and basil chicken. The flavor was good, but it didn't stand out from other Thai places in the area. My wife is a spice warrior," and even she thought the """"medium"""" spicy was hot. The portions are small", especially if you order with rice on the side. There were barely any noodles in the pad kee mao - more tofu and veggies than noodle, and the eggplant was good, but again, skimpy on the portion size. Maybe this is because we ordered to go? This place satisfied our Thai craving, but I doubt I'll dine in or takeout again. There are so many better places, but we wanted to try something new. 3 stars for the price and the spice, minus 2 for the skimpy portions and lack of noodles.|OMG this place . Please try their Tom Kha Kai and their surprisingly good Mojitos .Coming back here|My friends and I ended up having food here for lunch and I thought it was mostly okay. The place itself is very nice looking and clean," and for the price it was a pretty nice overall environment.I got the Khao Soi and it wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. The """"crispy"""" noodles on top felt more like just broken up dried noodles poured on top", and the noodles were a bit overcooked a kind of soggy in areas. The curry wasn't that flavorful and overall it wasn't amazing.That being said, the dish itself wasn't terrible and was enjoyable to eat, so in ways it is quite acceptable.|It's not a cooking I like. Because for me it's too spicy and you can't be able to distinguish anything after eating 3 spoons or 3 forks. I was just settled in this area for a week and I found this restaurant for eating a soup after a day rain. I ordered a soup and it was with two ingredients they often use in Thai cooking : coconut milk and pepper.However, it was warm for me and I took away for tomorrow.Great place and personals were kind," generous and talkative.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chabaa Thai Cuisine	""|A bit of a hole-in-the-wall -- in a good way!Seating is a bit tight", but the food was quick and tasty.|Stopped here for dinner one night when I was in town for work. This spot was right across from the hotel I was staying at. It's a super tiny place with only maybe 10 tables inside. I was waiting to pick up my to go order and kept feeling like there was no good place to stand. I ordered the guay tiew noodles, which were the wide rice noodles with fish cake and ground chicken. The flavors were kind of all over the place for me and I just didn't love it. I'd had something like this dish once before in LA and had really enjoyed it but was pretty disappointed here.|I ordered tom yum chicken and steamed rice. Although I didn't smell the signature sweet aroma of the jasmine rice, I definitely enjoyed the subtle aromas of the tom yum. The soup was seasoned perfectly (for me) and did not have the heat I typically associate with Thai cuisine. And the mushrooms? Very delicious!I'm not sure if I paired my meal well with hot ginger tea because the flavors didn't seem to jive somehow. But the tea was delicious too; perfect for a cold afternoon in the City.|The neighborhood Thai restaurant is a mainstay of living in SF.  When I first moved in the city, Tom Kha Gai and Pad Thai were their own food group.  Every section of the city has one or two inexpensive places where you can get flavorful Thai food and Chabaa is such a place on Geary across the street from the Curran and ACT. I've come here a few times now - they are really good for a quick dinner pre-show and there can be a reasonably long line of folks here since it's close to a touristy area. The food is solid. I came here recently for lunch and had the Hol Jor (deep fried stuffed bean curd paper) and the Guay Tiew Lord (basically seafood with ground chicken over flat rice noodles).  Portion size is huge (had enough leftover for dinner). Service is surprisingly good for an ethnic place and can't beat the price here (Under $20).  It's a good neighborhood spot and I wouldn't hesitate coming here.|I would've given 5 stars for the food but the restaurant itself is hella small and they crammed me and four of my friends into this space that was barely for 3 people.  Not to mention the restaurant was stuffy as heck!!!  I got Pad Thai which was delicious.  And they provided chopped peanuts as a condiment, which was to me a definitely plus.  Again, food 5 stars, ambiance 2 or 1 star.|What a really Ni e place with friendly staff, quick service and priced very reasonably.|We visited this location on a Saturday evening because they seemed to have a good set of vegetarian options. It was a little chilly that Saturday, and a lot of us wanted hot soup.I ordered the Tom Yum noodle soup with silver noodles. I found this dish to be lacking. The portion size was huge, which I guess was a plus? But the soup does not taste like what tom yum should taste like. Instead of spicy and sour, like it should be, this was sweet. I was not a huge fan of it. My friend had some vegetarian noodle soup option, and her soup broth looked so clear. She later told me that it tasted like nothing--like it was just water.The food also took a really long time to arrive at the table. There were four of us. One of our meals arrived first (about 15 minutes after we ordered), and then 5-7 minutes later, two more meals arrived, but we had to wait at least 7-10 minutes for our friend's vegetarian noodle soup to arrive. We thought they forgot about the last bowl, but it turns out that they were just slow with making the food.Anyway, I think overall, this place could be much better. The service was slow, and the food could've been better. I've had much better Thai food, but maybe it was the dishes we ordered. I would be willing to go back and try other dishes if one of my friends wanted to visit, but my recommendation would be to stay away from the tom yum soup...or maybe just the noodle soups in general.|EXCELLENT," reasonably priced (and located near Union Square) !!!  Efficient service.  Daily 8-10 pm """"Happy Hour"""" (reduced) food and drink offerings !!!  If you enjoy Thai cuisine (mild to spicy HOT - give this place a try !!!|Walking around Union Square with a friend and decided to grab dinner here. It is a tiny hole in the wall with the chairs all bunched together", you need to watch your elbows. The food came out fast and was pretty good. We shared the rolls, the tom kha soup, pad thai and yellow curry.|I ordered veggie curry and papaya salad. Too much for one person but I wanted to try a few things on the menu. Everything was amazing and a great value for the money. The setup is a little weird with the kitchen in the front and seats in the back. Other than that, food came quickly and there was a lot of it. The servers were on top of my every need. I enjoyed it and I highly recommended going here. It was delicious.|We decided to walk the short distance from our hotel to pickup dinner after checked into our hotel.  We arrived at 10:45 P.M. to get a takeout order.  When I opened the door, a startled employee told me that they were closed.  Hmm ok closing 1 hour and 15 minutes early?  We chose Chabaa as it was one of the few places open late (Yelp and all of the websites we checked them out at listed their closing time as 12:00 A.M.) in Union Square that was close to our hotel.  The hotel staff told us that the food selection gets very limited in Union Square later at night.Since some restaurant have different operating times for dining in versus delivery or takeout, I attempted to see if we could get our food delivered instead.  Nope, not a chance.  Delivery in the Yelp app displayed a message Chabaa was not taking any orders for delivery, try pickup instead.   Hmm, we tried that option already.An establishment should always indicate to customers that they are closed with proper signage.|Their chicken wings are a MUST to get here. They might be one of my favorite wings that I've had so far. You definitely need to try it! The rice dish in my photo was pretty good, but be careful when eating it because there are some pretty hard pieces in it. They might be little bone chips, I'm not really sure. It was tasty though, so eat at your own risk I guess.Overall, I enjoyed the two dishes. I would come back to order the chicken wings again.|A good Thai restaurant.  My favorite about this place is that the Thai cooks, who even though they may not have every Thai dish on the menu, will know how to make most Thai dishes.  I have been coming to this place for 10 years.  Both when I worked in the city, and now, when I visit for business.  The faces may have changed, and the prices have gone up (but then, what in SF hasn't gone up in price), but the dishes are still just as good.  I love the hole in the wall, smallness of the place.If you are going a business meeting, I would suggest Thai Stick on Post street, but for quality lunch and quick food, this is my favorite.|Horrible pad Thai. They get a sweet and sour sauce out of the jar and dump it on the noodles. It's so sweet that I couldn't even eat 20% of it. By far the worst pad Thai I have ever tried|This place is really good and reminds me of a lot of authentic places in Asia because it's so small and cramped but never lacks quality when it comes to food.I found this place when I looked for vegetarian restaurants and thought this is vegetarian only. I was wrong. The vegetarian menu is as diverse and as big as the rest of the menu. Don't get a headache picking a dish.I have to say this is one of the few places that actually still serves the customer a decent amount of food. One plate will get you full. The service is very quick as well.|Ordered delivery, had the worst experience. Delivery was very late, and we watched the delivery guy on the app stand at a corner for about 30 minutes.When the food finally arrived, we thought, this better be good! It was not. The vegetables in our udon stir fry were definitely frozen and reheated. They did not taste fresh. The chicken was tough and dry. All of the dishes were mediocre, at best.Really disappointed and sad with our 9pm dinner :(|Hole in the wall Thai food place that serves food on green bowls and plates! This place is fairly small, but the food is soo good and is a very reasonable price. It's especially great when compared to the other eateries around it. Because it's a hole in the wall restaurant, it's very easy to miss it. I have came here 2x and loved the food. I've gotten the Tom Yum Soup and Green Curry. Both were good but I just wished that they could have been spicier. Parking: There is street parking, but whenever I go to SF I just park in a lot and walk around or I just take the BART.Liked: The reasonable prices, the nice staff, the ease of being able to split checks when eating with a group, the different sauces, the food is really goodDisliked: the level of spiciness of the food, the size of the Thai iced tea/coffee (it was a small plastic cup because we had asked for it to go) Best Part: The ease of splitting the checks amongst  my friends and I, but the food was also really goodReturn: Most Definitely|Tiny little place so the wait can be pretty long (we almost wandered off to get pizza but persevered until a table was free), but food comes out quickly. Good price for a good quantity of delicious food. I got the eggplant+chicken dish with rice and it was exactly what I needed after a long day of shopping. The eggplant and chicken were both tender, juicy, and flavorful. The spices were apparent but not overwhelming. Overall, generous portions, tasty food, efficient service.|I really like this place, especially for Thai food downtown. It's small inside and gets really crowded, so expect a wait or consider ordering takeout.On my previous visit, my friend and I ordered the roast duck noodle soup and panang curry. Both were delicious and packed with flavor. I highly recommend them! Portions are also quite large so the two of us couldn't finish all of our food. I've had the noodle dishes here also and recommend those as well.|The yellow curry and roti are on pair with the dipped, pan-seared duo in taste, texture, and composition. The well-done chicken complements the roti perfect for the person who craves a crunch to the savory soup. I would ask for an extra roti as much soup is left. Also, roti are cut into eighths making each piece two bites. Therefore," I would ask for mine to be cut it into ninths or tenths- function over presentation any day.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Koh Samui & The Monkey	""|I couldnt even tell what kind of food they have here when my friend told me abuot this place. Turned out the food to be pretty good. One of the item we ordered", forgot its name already, gave us a whole pineapple. Definitely a little surprised. Would love to come back and check out more items on the menu in the future.|I've come here to dine in for lunch once and for MealPal twice. Dining in I was very underwhelmed. The service was a bit slow but the food is good. Huge big open spot, nothing to say wow over but good price and friendly but slow service. For MealPal I have ordered twice because I'm lazy and I want Thai food. Huge portion of rice and then small/medium portion of meat. If they made the portions more balanced I think it would be a winner. With that said the food is always delicious.  I just end up throwing out half the rice because it's more than any human being should eat.Solid option for thai craving, spicy chicken and curry dishes are good.|Large spacious restaurant. However during my visit I notice most patrons order take out, and most apps offer online ordering. To order, as you enter, check off what you want to order, give to staff and take a seat. Food was good, had garlic ginger chicken. Good amounts protein.|This review is specifically for the Korad Duck Noodle Soup.Ordered this on a whim because I was craving noodle soup and this was closest option. I've never heard of this dish before today so I don't know what I was expecting but it definitely was not worth the $15 I paid for it. Soup was bland, duck was hard and the greens barely existent so was very, very disappointed. Couldn't even eat half and ended up throwing it away :(|Came here on a weekday for lunch with coworkers. Menu was pretty pricey and food was extremely mediocre. I ordered the pad see ew, which  was bland and the portion was small. Won't be back...|To be precise - I give them a 3.5. Came here for lunch with my sister who works nearby. Upon entrance, it took a minute for anyone to even acknowledge us. It was probably the tail end of the lunch rush. Not a big deal to wait, just felt awkward as there was a bunch of people leaving and we had nowhere to go but stand by the entrance/podium. After we were seated, everything felt nice with the windows letting in a perfect amount of light. Service was fine, as I don't have any complaints. What it came down to was the food. The pad see ew was good - a very fair amount for the price and the flavor was good. The panang on the other hand was very disappointing. It wasn't sweet and the flavor was off, the tofu seemed a bit off..perhaps even a bit sour. I'm fairly forgiving so this could've just been an off day. I think I'd definitely get them another try.|Koh Samui & The Monkey is in the heart of SOMA, aka startup central of SF. We walked in at 12pm on a Tuesday, and were asked if we had a reservation. We did not, and were seated at a two top by the window pretty quickly. Food: We ordered the Panang curry with chicken instead of beef. A bowl of curry arrived with a side of rice. Tasted OK. Not spicy, and looked heavy on the coconut milk. The belly basil was a pork belly stir fry with Chinese broccoli. The pork belly had been previously deep fried, and then added to the stir fry. This was pretty tasty. Pork belly seldom disappoints. Service: It was the beginning of lunch, but as most tables were still filling up, it was still a bit slow for getting our order taken. Food took a little longer, but came out hot and fresh. Water needs to be requested, but staff were good at keeping them filled. Cost: The two entrees ran us about $27 after tax. Overall: They've also got a to-go area when you first enter the building if you want a quicker option.|I find curries very comforting. When deciding what to pick for our Friday office lunch, I realized I hadn't had Thai curry in a while. Decided to try Koh Samui & The Monkey. It arrived on April 14th around 12 noon via Forkable.Green Curry Beef ($13): *Sliced beef with bamboo shoots, zucchini, basil, and bell pepper in green curry; served with jasmine rice*Choice of Rice: sub Brown Rice (+$1)I was a little delicate from the night before, so I really needed carbs! The brown rice was actually the best part of my meal. Perfectly cooked. Soft and chewy, but not mushy. The curry, however, was a little too thin for me. Almost watery. I love thicker curries, so this was a little disappointing. Almost like spooning soup on my rice. Not quite the sauciness I wanted. There was an average amount of meat and veggies (maybe even less than normal), but I think because the curry was so thin, it just seemed less substantial. It did have a nice flavor and they made it spicy, which I indicated on my order.Loved the brown rice, but the star of my meal didn't really shine. If you like thin curries, this may be the spot for you. But I need my thick, saucy, comforting curry. 4 stars for the rice, but 2 for the curry. Averaging it out to 3 stars.|The food here is ok, although rather small portions. The prices are at the upper range of mid-priced for San Francisco. The wait staff is always a bit cold, stand-offish and snooty. They have this new, very strange and even more distancing process where you circle your orders on a piece of paper before you sit down--like at a deli or something. It's weird. And it's another layer between you and your experience eating here. It's very close to where I work, and that's its main selling point for me--and I still don't go there very often.|Pretty typical Thai food here at a slightly higher price. I ordered the Pad Thai with beef and I would say it was pretty typical. I also ordered the pot of gold appetizer which was pretty good. It's kind of like fried spring roll wrap with fish paste inside. Something new that I haven't tried before. For a group of 6 or more there is an 18% gratuity, which I wouldn't mind except the service was quite average.|disgraceful. food is bland and not as flavorful as much as it should be. Look at these pad see ew noodles. They're white. It should be golden brown, because they're supposed to be STIR FRIED NOODLES.|The service is weird. I didn't realize that I had to take a menu and seat myself. Then nobody came to pick up the check so we paid ourselves at the counter. The food was okay for what it was. The catfish was too salty and the red curry was bland.|0 STARS if possible, this place is a joke!I came here for lunch because I work right down the street in SOMA.  I arrived around 11:45 when there was no crowd, was seated right away and ordered my food.  20 minutes later," I receive an apology on the long wait because they had """"an inspector"""" visiting.  I reasonably expected the food to come out of the kitchen", so I put my credit card on the table so I could pay once my food arrived.Instead of receiving food, the waiter brings me the check and apologized for the wait. I told him I hadn't received any food yet, so I'm not paying for anything.  This is now 35 minutes later and I still haven't got food. He asked me if the food was ready was I actually going to eat it. I thought this was going to be a quick lunch but it turned out to be the biggest waste of time I've ever had in a restaurant.I've had take-out here before but Koh Samui & The Monkey will never get a dime from me ever again.  Your restaurant service is garbage and the wait time is ridiculous for air.  I hope this place goes out of business from lackluster service and experience.|It's not the only Thai restaurant in the neighborhood with a rice plate lunch special but extra props to Koh Samui & The Monkey for accepting credit cards too. They have a rotating weekday menu where you can get rice and 2 dishes for around $8-9. Slightly more than Ozone a couple of blocks away but I really appreciate that they take credit cards and trust you enough to walk away with your food to go next door into the dining room to pay with plastic. Pretty standard Thai fare like pad Thai, basil chicken, a variety of curries (meat and veggie)," and other stir fry dishes. The one standout is something that is simply called """"crispy chicken"""" and it is exactly what it's called. Crispy fried bits of chicken dressed in a sweet and spicy sauce. So yummy and addictive", I can eat it for days. For a quick grab and go lunch that is more substantial that a salad, Koh Samui & The Monkey does a good job of keeping things fresh daily with its rotating menu and decent servings.|Koh Samui & The Monkey, hidden away in the SoMa district, is home to lots of delicious quality Thai food!I come here every once in a while with coworkers as it's not too far from where I work and I enjoy the food here every time. Their appetizers are always a delight to have and I recommend the chicken satay, fried calamari, and crunchy puff in this area. They have some set meals for lunch which I believe come with a starter, entree, and drink for a good deal. Their pad thai and pad kee mao are very solid dishes, with their pad thai having a good amount of sweetness and the pad kee mao packing in quite the heat. There are also some interesting dishes here such as a seafood udon pad thai which was absolutely delicious and unique.The service here is great and friendly. The seating and atmosphere is clean and nice for a casual meal. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for some delicious thai food in a comfortable sit down environment!|WHYYYYYYYY? Why would you move the takeout counter into the restaurant? The only thing I like about this new setup: The lovely lady who runs it and the food is still good. But boy did you miss the mark with the new set up. The line is so long now and you know what everyone is doing while waiting? We are COMPLAINING about how much we hate the new set up. GO BACK if you know what's good for you. The only reason I'm coming back is because I love the takeout lady!|2.5 dinnerNot terribly impressed with our 4 person dinner of about 5 courses. Sauce more than anything substantive. Fish entree was small, but must say that was the tastiest thing I put in my mouth.Tired, with no vibe to speak of the weeknight I patronized. But!!! We walked right past it and it was a no brainer after starters over at that Little skillet chicken drink place....Could not recommend this establishment|Ordered on Postmates and delivery time was crazy long.  A bit more than an hour?  It was ridiculous.  I got Tom Yum Kung Soup and Pad Kee Mow.  One of the two gave me really bad acid reflux, I think it was the noodles. I didn't enjoy the food, which is all I can vouch for.  I can't comment on the service or restaurant ambiance, but I definitely do not recommend going through Postmates.|Chanika is awesome. She is making me these fantastic drinks. I'm very happy. Food is good. I asked them for extra spicy. They make it close to authentic thai good. I would recommend crispy pork with Chinese broccoli very good. Plus for warriors fan they have TVs and big screen on! Loving it.|What a great lunch deal! Excellent atmosphere, food and price!Appetizer," main dish + Thai drink (Thai Iced tea for me) ~$16.00!I will come back here :-)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"King’s Thai Cuisine 1	""|Only had take out (ordered ahead on Yelp) from here so far but overall it was delicious. Really enjoyed the Tom Kha Gai Soup", Gang Panang Curry, and the Guay Tiew Moo Look Chin Pia Soup with small rice noodle (though might try it with vermicelli next time).There wasn't an explicit way to specify spice level but things were mostly fairly mild with just a hint of heat, which was nice. The Tom Kha Gai was the spiciest thing we got, which was awesome, I feel like I've only ever had Tom kha without _any_ spice before but now I'm always going to get it this way.|King's Thai Cuisine #1 will always have a special place in my heart since it was one of the first Thai restaurants I've eaten at. I was born around the area and my parents would take me here whenever they had a craving for Thai food. The reason why my rating isn't a 5 is because the pad Thai here doesn't taste as good as I remembered it to be many years ago. I came here with my father and younger sister after they picked me up from the airport. We ordered a couple of #4s, a kind of beef noodles soup, and a tofu and veggie pad Thai. The noodle soups taste pretty much the same as I remember-- beefy, rich and slightly spicy. However, the pad Thai just was a bit bland. I remember liking the green curry, so maybe I'll opt for that the next time I visit!|People are getting the other location of this restaurant on Clement, which is called King's Thai Noodles #2, confused with this place, which is KTN #1.  This is the smaller, simpler location closer to 8th St. that has the purple storefront and, although VERY basic interior (e.g., fluorescent lighting), has WAY WAY better food, better prices and much nicer servers than the other, fancier location -- which is down the street near 4th St and has terrible food and service (see my review there and other reviews). If you don't mind the casual interior you will have a much better eating experience at King's Thai Noodles #1.  It's hard to believe the two restaurants are related, they are world's apart in quality.Unfortunately, #1's overall rating is much lower than it should be because people are getting the two confused and giving low stars to this one when it should be for location #2.  Double-check you got the right location when leaving a review!|Ate lunch here weekday. Street meter parking $2.25 /hour. Pad Kee Mao and Beef noodle soup. Tastes authentic. Decor in Thai and picture of old king /queen. Food tasty but maybe less sugar seasoning for me|My favorite Thai restaurant, I often order roast duck  noodles soup here, and the soup made here is really tasty. This restaurant, which requires cash payments, is small but is better and more affordable than king of Thai 2, which is two blocks away. High Recommend|Chicken Satay with peanut sauce = delicious!Peanut Sauce = delicious!Pad See Lew = blandGai Pad Med Ma-Muang = decent, not a dish I would get a second time.We had to dump the remaining peanut sauce on the Pad See Lew to give it more flavor since it was just very bland. Overall this place was ok, but if I tried it again I would ask for extra peanut sauce and try something *spicy* to get more flavor.|Your standard, typical, hole-in-the-wall Thai place. Definitely more take-out/delivery than sit-down restaurant. The prices are on the cheaper side but that means the portions are on the smaller side as well.- Duck Noodle Soup: slices of roast duck on your choice of noodles. I went with the thin rice noodles and it was a good combination. Definitely on the saltier/soy sauce-heavy side but I just wanted the duck so it worked out. It supposedly came with vegetables...... but that was questionable.- Green Curry: boy says it was solid!- Thai ice tea: always on the sweeter side, but what else would you expect.Good if in a pinch (and for those late night hours) but definitely would not be anyone's first choice lol|Hole in the wall dive Thai restaurant. I'm not sure where all these uppity yelp reviews are coming from, or if these people have even been to Thailand, but the food here is about as authentic as it comes. Having visited  Thailand going on 10x now for work I can say this place is the closest I've found to the rustic, gritty, authentic Thai food I'd get in the nooks and crannies of Bangkok. It's not pretty, the service is adequate," but the food is really quite good and """"rustic"""" so far as Thai goes.Quit comparing it to Americanized Thai food and comp it against a dive in Bangkok and you'll find it's as real as it gets!|Say what you like about this place", but it has several great things going for it:1. Its late hours--open till 1:30 AM on Saturdays!2. Its central location--right on the main drag, and therefore easy to locate.3. It's price to portion ratio. For downtown, prices are very fair for what you get.I tried the pad see ew with tofu (as always). Delicious. I was craving greasy Thai noodles and these delivered. The rice noodles were fat, the tofu was crisp, and there were some unexpected vegetable additions--baby corn and mushrooms. Let's just say there was none to take home.Sadly, my dining companion was a different story. He's used to restaurants where more ample helpings of meat are offered so, in reading the menu, he was less than enthused. He finally decided on the duck fried rice and ended up leaving some.I enjoyed the selection of sauces and toppings that are left out on the tables--even found my favorite, crushed peanuts.If you want something quick, this may not be a good bet. It was PACKED when I visited and there was a line out the door. There was more than one server attending to us, and it looked like they were doing the best they could, but we still had to wait a while for the food and the check. Also, some of them don't speak the best English so good luck requesting any substitutions/alterations to listed items.Overall, it was a satisfying meal. I'd return if in the area.|My father had eaten here a few days ago and saw that they have delivery.  Living in the Richmond District, parking on a Saturday night can be hard.  Delivery is great for us, because he is 88 and has a hard time getting around.  We ordered the chicken larb and the pork basil chile for delivery on Saturday night.  The person who took the order told us that it would be 45-50 minutes.  An hour later," our food had not arrived so I called to follow up.  She told us """"he is leaving right now.""""Our food arrived 95 minutes after we had ordered and was luke warm.  It was tasty but needed to be microwaved.I am sure they were busy (the delivery driver told me he had five orders on the run when he brought us our food) but this was very poorly managed and messaged.Next time", we will order from somewhere else.|-Small hole in the wall spot with seating in the back -very casual atmosphere, nothing fancy-chefs are cooking in the front so it's authentic and good quality -cash only -would only recommend this for takeout or quick food since the ambiance was so casual, not a special dining experience -I got the pumpkin curry vegetable style and it was really good!-saw on the wall they had won some awards -3 stars for ambiance -3 stars for customer service -3.5 stars for value (most items $10-15) -5 stars for vegetarian pumpkin curry -overall 3.5 stars but will round it to 4 :)|I'm so glad this late night chain is open until midnight. You know sometimes you crave for a meal where you don't want Burger King, McDonald's, Carl's Junior, or any type of burger related. You just want a decent meal?! This place is not the best but food comes out quick and flavorful.At least when you ask them for spicy they really do make it spicy. Some Thai restaurants that I've tried in San Francisco will not make it to specification.  But when you live in the Richmond, there's no el farolito around. Do I want to drive that far for my quesadilla or burrito and bunch of salsas? Not really. This will do!|Delicious thai food with the perfect flavor and spiciness. Definitely try their pad kee mao.|I'm giving this place up to 3 stars for its consistency. I've called orders in several times and the food is always prepared fresh and ready within 15 minutes. I've gotten pad Thai, curry, pad see ew and a few appetizers. I'm giving this place only 3 stars because the food lacks flavor and is overall uninspiring. I've also found that they put very little protein of choice in your dish. Last time I ordered tofu pad Thai there were only 4-5 small pieces of tofu in my dish.|I have never written a review. I am so disgusted with the incredibly rude service I just received I needed to let others know to beware! If I could  give -0- stars I would. We ordered 3 entrees and asked for 3 chopsticks and 1 fork.They originally gave us only 2 chopsticks and when I asked for a 3 rd and the waitress consulted with the other waitress and then replaced the Chopsticks I was originally given with a cheaper version. The first kind of chopsticks in my bag were the nice individually wrapped ones. The waitress took the 2 out and replaced them with the cheap break apart kind with all the splinters and when I said I wanted the others they just took them. Also our pad Thai was only a 1/2 box of noodles and 1/2 bean sprouts.. so cheap.There are amazing food spots and restaurants on clement street, this is not one of them!Go anyplace else!!|I've lived in SF for 17 years now and have never experienced such rude service from an establishment to date. I initially called and asked to make a delivery order because on Yelp it indicates that they do indeed deliver. I was told by the woman on the phone that they do not deliver. I then proceeded to let them know that it might be a good idea to let Yelp know so that they can correct the information to avoid confusion. I then decided to go ahead and proceed with ordering take out instead, but she rudely hung up on me. I was a bit irked, but I figured perhaps there is a bit of a language barrier, or perhaps she was having a bad day as we all do from time to time. So, I went a head and called back to place and order. I let her know that the menu I have has no numbers and that I will definitely butcher the dish's name so I asked if I may spell it for her and read the description. She said 'yes' and I proceeded to do so. She then kept saying 'number 16? Number 16?' I then re-iterated what I had explained earlier, that the menu had no numbers. She said that's fine and I got dressed to walk over and pick my food. When I arrived they had made the wrong dish. I let her know that this is not what I ordered. I showed her on the menu and then she and the cook looked at me as if I did something terribly rude and offensive. She then asked me what kind of noodles I would like, so in an attempt to try and lighten the mood a bit I smiled and asked what does she recommends and what is her favorite. She looked at the cook like I was trying to be difficult. She then said 'rice noodles' with no smile or eye contact whatsoever. At this point I'm really trying to bite my tongue and just let it be. I patiently waited outside until my food was ready....she then brought out the food and had the audacity to tell me that if I'm unsure about what I want it's best that I just come into the establishment rather than call in the order. At that point I had had enough. I told her I literally spelled out the dish's name and read the description to her. She had the nerve to blame the situation on me rather than take some responsibility for her mistake. The order total was $10.35, I gave her a $20 and said to just give me $7 back in yet another attempt to be nice and cordial. She came back with all my change instead andShoved it in my hand. I said, 'I only asked for $7 back, Im trying to tip you.' She just kept walking and ignored me. So I went inside and threw the money on the counter and said they're unbelievable. Zero apologies, zero thank you's, and zero responses to my several attempts to try and be cool about the multiple layers of rudeness I had received. I'm a local musician and eat at all kinds of scrappy hole in the walls with mediocre service..., but I left this place absolutely disgusted and livid. I live in the neighborhood and I am super bummed that they were so freakin' rude. I like to support local businesses and they are a great late night spot typically, but this experience has deterred me from EVER supporting their establishment again, and I will have nothing nice to say about this place when people ask me about it. They could really take a page out of Thai Time's book (on 8th Ave.) when it comes to service.|These zagat rated stickers threw me off. I expected more from this place since it is the original restaurant and it is so well-recognized. Right when you walk in, you see the kitchen and where they cook the food. Which isn't a bad thing. It definitely has that old school Asia vibe. However, the bathroom is literally right next to tables. You automatically get a whiff of bathroom right when you sit down. We ordered why every Thai place is known for: yellow curry and pad see ew. They forgot to put carrots in our curry so it was literally just onion, potato, and chicken. Pretty uneventful dish. Pad see ew had broccoli that was off. I would bite into a mouth full of broccoli stems, but the inedible part. I don't know. This place is just eh.|Meh. I ordered the Kao Pad Ped (fried rice with roast pork, Chinese sausage, egg, and tomato). It was $12 for some overly salty fried rice, a nickel-sized slice of pork, a few similar-sized slices of pork skin and no Chinese sausage.Maybe I didn't order the right item on the menu but I don't have high hopes for King's Thai given some of the other reviews.Cash only and limited seating.|Food is good, just need to come here with cash only. It's fast, tasty and straight to the point.|Great food, great for pickup," friendly staff and everything was hot and ready when I arrived.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Osha Thai	""|A coworker and I stopped at Osha Thai on a lunch break while in town for some work training. I really liked the vibe inside - sort of classy and upscale but still cozy. They had fun chandeliers over one large table and a little lounge area. We sat at a low counter on the side of the bar.The menu is large with lots of Thai options to choose from", including options I'd never seen before like pumpkin curry and garlic lamb ribs - yum! We ordered the crab rangoon to start which were pretty good; crispy and hot with plenty of cream cheese! For our entrees we both chose the spicy eggplant, which you can get with chicken, beef, or pork. They also give you an option for brown or coconut rice, but I think both are an upcharge, so be aware. I got mine with chicken, and my coworker ordered hers with shrimp (which was an extra cost). Our food came out pretty quickly without too much waiting. The eggplant was great - cooked perfectly and a great texture. The chicken was also tender and not dry at all. I will note that it had absolutely zero spice, which was kind of a bummer because I love spicy food! But the flavors were great and it was a perfect portion - I ate it all but didn't feel weighed down or over full. Service was okay, it was a little bit slow as it was a busy lunch hour. We had to flag down a bartender for our checks so make sure you leave plenty of time if you're on a schedule. I'm glad we ended up here because I really enjoyed the food!|I went with my gf here for dinner one night. The food there is typically solid, but I was really mad at the service.My gf ordered a tom yum soup with noodles on the side. The server did not ask what kind of noodle so she assumed he would bring rice noodles. Instead, she got egg noodles. When she asked to get rice noodles, the server said he could not do that. Then she said to him she got rice noodles the last time. And then the server's response was to blame my girlfriend for picking egg noodles when in fact he never even offered her options. His job is to give her the choices for different kinds of noodles. He told her to pick the right noodles next time.How can a server lie and tell a customer that they made an error when the customer was not given options?Bad manners is all I can say.|Went here with a couple of friends after work. We had a reservation for 7pm (probably didn't need one though) and they seated us right away.I got the Yellow Curry ($14) with a side of rice and the flavors were good even for just the veggie version, a little spicy (but I am not used to a lot of spice, so probably not spicy to most people). I do wish the vegetables were cooked a little longer- they tasted a bit raw. My friend got the Pad See You ($14) which she always gets when she comes here. I tried it and it was good (a bit on the sweeter side), but I wish there was more vegetables in it. My other friend got the Ka-Prow-Kai ($14), which she also liked. Overall, the food was decent (a little pricy for the portion in my opinion). However, the biggest downfall was that we wanted to get dessert, but right after we got our dishes taken away, before we could ask for a dessert menu, he handed us the check without even asking if we wanted anything else. It seemed like he was trying to rush us out, even though the restaurant wasn't busy. While I would give this place another try, I was not pleased with the service.|So im generally not a fan of this place, but my team came here for a group lunch as they're one of the few spots in my neighborhood that can cater to the large size of my group.Their service was impressive. They took our order and brought our food out quickly, our waters were always filled, and empty plates always disposed of. That made up for the disappointing meal.Okay, I ordered the Crisp Salmon... It was horribly overcooked - rubbery and chewy, and horrrrrribly oversalted... No wonder they kept refilling our water glasses!I tasted the Lemongrass Sea Bass and overall that dish had a lot better flavoring and the fish was perfectly cooked. Overall, it worked for our large party and they took reservations, but if it's my dime, it won't be at the top of my food list.|While attending training in San Francisco a coworker and I went to Osha Thai for our hour and a half lunch break since it was close and they had a great presence on Yelp (good pictures, good reviews, etc.)!There were so many tasty options we both had trouble deciding what to order. We started with their Dungeness crab ragoon and both ordered spicy eggplant stir fry. Their crab ragoon had quite a bit of onion and celery in it- so if you're not a fan of either I would recommend trying something else. I added shrimp to my stir fry for an upcharge and was pleased. However, if you get it with coconut rice there's an upcharge as well which I wasn't warned about.The only downfall is service was a little on the slow side. If you're in a hurry you may want to reconsider or at least let them know ahead of time so they can work to ensure you get in and out quickly.Overall we both enjoyed our experience here!|Osha's atmosphere is really chill and it's in a convenient location in SoMa, so it's a favorite of nearby tech workers. The food is fairly typical Thai food, but everything tastes better when you're sitting at such a nice table.The one complaint I have is that even for Thai food, Osha's dishes are quite sweet. I ordered the volcanic beef and was surprised that they managed to make a beef dish so sweet. Still, it was pretty good. Tender. Also heard good things about the curry.Food is expensive, but not more expensive than you would expect from that kind of place. Get your company to cover it.|My team often comes here for team lunches. They offer good food, and can accommodate a large group if you call ahead. I really like their Thai Iced Coffee and yellow curry.|Not so impressed with their food/drinks.. everything is very sweet.. except that the service was not that sweet :(The front desk let us hanging, standing at the front for about 15 minutes, after she initially approached us, she disappeared. Server did not come to take order eventhough she walked by our desk, until we have to walk to get her come to our desk to take order!I would not recommend ordering seafood here, especially the seabass! The broth of this dish is very sweet, I really think they should learn how to cook fish!!! The Thai ice tea tasted like sugar! It is still extremely sweet eventhough I added a glass of water on the half glass of the Thai ice tea!This place is packed with hungry professionals during lunchtime.The interior design is old, need renovation.|Made a reservation for 12 people for my birthday on Yelp and it was such an easy process. Upon entering, the restaurant looks upscale and would be a great place for dates, birthday parties, and business dinners. Yes, this place is more expensive than your average Thai restaurant but it is delicious. Service is also great so that's a plus.Thai Samosa (appetizer) - This came out nice and hot, with the perfect amount of filling inside. The cucumber salad accompanied the samosas very well. I wish they gave more cucumber salad since I LOVE cucumber.Pad Thai w/ beef (entree) - The portion for the pad thai was probably the biggest compared to the other entrees. It was a lot of noodles but it would've been nice if there was more beef as well. Nothing that WOWed me, but this one did taste decent.Yellow Curry w/ chicken (entree) - My favorite entree out of the two. Spices and flavor was right, and the amount of chicken provided was more than enough. I would re-order dish next time.Thailander (cocktail) - Delicious cocktail that tastes like juice. As a light weight, I felt buzzed when I was done though.Will return if I ever need a bite around the area. Keep up the great work Osha!|I think Osha would be a nice lunch spot. But the food to me is just meh. I had the Kurobuta Pork Noodle Soup. This bowl is huge omg. There were two big pieces of braised pork belly on top of the noodle. The broth was kinda on the salty side. I believe they have better stuff tho. Just bc I went here when they was about to close so might not have the best experience.|Had leftovers of this place, some kind of flat egg noodles with pork and chicken, tasted really good despite being leftovers. Have to come here and get it fresh, I'm sure it'll be great.|Had dinner in the Lounge on a Thursday evening.- veggie stone clay pot bowl was basically bok choy & tofu- very little other veggies as the description states. However good flavor. - chicken lettuce wraps (per my partner)- were also good.  - rice veggie rolls as an app- tasty! - ordered wine," was given sparkling wine. Waters never showed up. Service is a little slow (she was super nice - but perhaps understaffed?). - very cute space. Good vibe. I'd give it another try.|I ordered Osha's Sea which is a seafood combination curry with rice. This is by far the most tasty and affordable Thai places in the neighborhood. Their plates look delicate and the overall service are well worthy the price. I also order Bacon Wrapped Scallop which is a wonderful combination and it turned out very well.|The husband loves OSHA. I remain unimpressed. I think it's very expensive for the quality of food. The volcanic beef is a ridiculous $23. I think that price is a new thing. I don't remember it topping $20 before. I was disappointed that several of the pieces weren't very tender. They should be fucking wagyu for the price. There were also too many beet strings. I know it was meant to be a garnish but it kept getting in the way.The menu said the country chicken was """"lightly fried chicken."""" In actuality it was very chewy overfried chicken. It was really disappointing. As a leftover it was completely inedible.|Came here for my graduation dinner last month with a table of about 12 people. Overall", I thought the service was good and food was great. We ordered quite a bit of food for all of us, and the waiters were kind in telling us what would be a good amt of food, etc. Drinks came out promptly when ordered and they were attentive despite having several other groups that night. Only thing was that portion sizes were fairly small, especially for the salads and appetizers. Prices were decent," and we were all able to eat and drink for under $700. I've eaten at the other locations before and while this one wasn't as """"pretty"""" as the others", I would come back with a group!|After a belly fully of laughter from Jo Koy, the tummy says let's go eat!When in doubt Osha never fails. I've been to the Geary, 2nd St, and Embarcadero location but not 3rd street. Decore on fleek aside with its cleanliness.We were warned Osha's last call to order food is in 45mins. Umm ok np bring it on.The dishes came out 5 minutes apart from each other. Quite impressed because I know them cooks needs to eat and go home too. I can't complain but our eyes were hungry, food was just as good as all their locations.Thank you Osha!|It's tucked away from the shades of its own building, but they have corner exposure, so one can see it if you are walking the streets.Good dining over Thai food.  I'm liking their pineapple fried rice and cocktail drinks.Adequate servings and service.  Spot on spot.|I've been to several of this chain and my favorite was the Embarcadero.  This site is my least favorite. We were in the area for a major conference and I came in by myself for lunch. The greeter at the door is the snootiest person I've seen in a long time. Such a poor attitude while he struts around to seat people. Go get another job as you're suppose to be welcoming and you're not while we're charged a health tax on our bill to pay for your medical insurance. The atmosphere is ice, the wait staff are young, overworked. I saw only 3 for the entire room and there were 2 large parties one with 13. I liked the Thai iced tea but my pad Thai was disappointing. It was dark colored, soggy and too sweet, not enough tofu but ample chicken and not worth $15.  I'd be better off at the cafeteria style food at Metreon or Westfield mall.  A friend joined me later and had the papaya salad. She said it was OK.  I'm making a mental note to avoid this site and go elsewhere for Thai food.|These are 4.5/5 stars because of the late order. I am not a big fan of Thai food but visited Osha for a team lunch. I didn't go with very high expectations but man their food definitely deserves 5 stars.Their appetizers are Americanized just like any other restaurant in San Francisco but the taste was extra ordinary. We ordered vegetarian spring rolls and Thai Samosas as appetizers and I personally ordered Angry Prawn with sticky rice as main course. After taking the first spoon of prawn, curry, sticky rice and eggplant my mind was simply blown. Each and every element of the dish was perfectly cooked with the right amount of spice and perfect quantity of sauce.Highly recommended for (not authentic but) tasty Thai food.|Great food, and don't order Thai spicy unless you're a baller!Came here on a weekday evening with a pretty large  group! Service was surprisingly quick and the place has a nice fine-dining ambience.I started with the mint tea which was good (not the best). We got the Vegetarian crispy rolls and they were brilliant with the sauces.For entree, I got the pad thai. I was being bold and asked for Thai spicy. The waiter confirmed if I was sure. I was like hell yeah. It was like hell," yeah. I had an extremely hard time finishing it but kinda my fault.Def a good place for lunch or dinner!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chabaa Thai Cuisine	""|Pretty good! Got the combo beef stew. The only complaint if I had one is the fact that it said it's suppose to be spicy", but I didn't find it spicy at all. (Which is great for non-spicy eaters).It was delicious.I love the appetizers as well! And I met up with my cousins Syd and TIff (who use to go here all the time) with them late that last Saturday night and we decided to get dinner here.I really liked the food. [:|Baloney sausage would be tastier. Waaaaaaay overrated. Pass the the bologna sandwiches.|Red duck curry - first time I ever had this. I don't know how other places make it but this was damn good. Super creamy! I ate all the rice with plenty curry left over. Even my friends were surprised I ate all the rice ! Can't wait to finish the curry leftovers with maybe some bread or more rice !Just adding on an item to share|Came with three friends on a Saturday for lunch and there was no wait. One of them had never tried the duck fried rice about which the rest of us had previously sung praises, so we decided to get two orders to share. The three of us who have ordered it before thought that it was unfortunately very mediocre compared to all the past times. It just wasn't as tasty, so that was a major disappointment, especially when introducing it to someone who had never had it. The tom ka with chicken and the pad si-yu with beef were fine. Service was good. Since the restaurant was empty, we sat and just talked for at least half an hour after our meal - the wait staff didn't make us feel like we were in the way and I really appreciated that. I'm not writing this restaurant off just yet - will need to return and try the duck fried rice again and see if they were just having an off day.|This is one of my favorite Thai spots in the city now. After getting practically yelled at for trying to even put my name down at Marnee Thai down the street, our group decided to walk a block over here. I am so glad that our turn in events brought us here. Despite being fairly empty, their service and food was great!To start, two of us got a Thai tea, which came with a flower made with the straw paper, how cute. I also decided to order the Chicken Satay ($5) on happy hour menu to share. It only came with three pieces, but still pretty good. I really enjoyed the refreshing crunch from the onion and cucumbers on top. They have a large selection on happy hour though, so hopefully I can try those next time.For the main entrees, I ordered the Pad See Ew with Pork ($8.95) and Red Curry with Roasted Duck ($10.45) to share with the boyfriend. The flavors were on point for all the dishes. I was seriously still scooping the curry to drink even when I had no more rice to eat it with. The portions are good and left us all very stuffed for an even better value. Definitely my new go-to for Thai cuisine!|Nasty place...i ordered fried chicken over fried rice..the chicken is raw inside and breading its half cook and it is sticky but the outside looks cook, it's nasty not going back here anymore and the customer service is not good|I wish there was a 0 star review!! This place is no good!! We came bc this was the only place open & we were very hungry so we ordered chicken pat thai and I couldn't even finish my food bc it was not good at all. On top of that I ended up with a $15 tip when I had to get up to get my own hot sauce!!|This is many of my Thai friend's Not the fanciest spot in the city, but the service and the food is always consistent and good.Their mango sticky rice and pineapple fried rice is unbeatable. Open late and fairly priced.|I've been here many times-food is consistently good. Chicken Pineapple Rice with Shrimp is the same like I've tried in Thailand. Service is good too.|Simply the best, I wonder why the 3.5 star rating for this place that deserves a 5 star. Great atmosphere, fantastic food, friendly service, clean place with high ceiling and nice a quiet. Tried three appetizers and a main dish, see for yourself(photos attached).|Ordered yellow chicken curry and shrimp pad Thai.  I found it to be overly sweet, and I even have a sweet tooth.  It actually made my tongue hurt.  Also, there were only four shrimp in the dish.  Otherwise, food came slightly late by 15 min from Eat24 and was just okay.|I enjoy eating here whenever I am in the city and in the area. There is usually no wait, it is a small restaurant with a homey feel to it. The price is kinda pricy, it's a little more expensive than what i usually pay for Thai food. The dishes that I have tried thus far here are angel wings, nam Kao, papaya salad, pad kee mao, Thai tea and tom yum noodle soup. I ordered pad Thai once here and it was a little on the dry side. The curry portion is slightly small but it is still tasty. The dish that I usually get is the tom yum noodle soup with rice stick noodle. This is by far the best dish I have ever tried. It's sweet and sour with a hint of spice. Every bite is bursting with flavor, your mouth and stomach will thank you. I like their service, they check in on you periodically and don't rush you out like other restaurants. Overall I suggest people give this place a try. Their food and service are good.|This is by far my go to place to eat! Always so satisfied and have to share: far left is cashew chicken with less spice - so good, perfectly cooked with just enough crunch! Top plate is prawn fried rice- also so good & simple yet a must! Bottom plate is beef pad see yi- I always get this every time and it taste the same each time! It's soooo good! Highly recommend their Thai iced tea too!|service: Ffood: B-location: BI don't usually post abysmal ratings, but this place has managed to assemble enough wrong into one dinner to warrant my time, so here goes. Came here for dinner tonight after a busy day, didn't feel like going somewhere too upscale, so my wife and I came here with gym casual clothes. My wife is pregnant and can't eat spicy food, so she ordered green curry and asked for mild. Our waitress seemed bothered, and not in the mood to take our order. w/e the night continues. My order came in 5 minutes, food was meh, wasn't great, wasn't bad either. My wife's green curry didn't come for another 20 mins, by this time I had already finished eating, and shared a bowl with her so she doesn't just watch me. We asked our waitress if her food was coming, she told us there wasn't an order from my wife. Confused, we asked her to double check, sure enough, she never wrote down my wife's order. She then acknowledged the mistake, and told us the order will be on its way. We double checked with her the order was for a mild green curry. She started to skirt our table for the next 20 minutes. When we asked her again," she very curtly said """"it will be here"""". So we waited. When the curry finally came", it was spicy. We asked her again, then she flatly said we never told her it was supposed to be mild. We are mild tempered people, so we didn't feel the need to confront her. And, by now, we had been waiting for over an hour for the right order to show up, and we decided it wasn't worth the effort to argue our point, so we asked for a box to go. Our waitress *couldn't see us* for the next 10 minutes, so we had to flag down someone else to bring us the box. Our waitress then came by and threw down the tab, as if to tell us to GTFO. I'm sorry, but I thought this was the service industry and customers were supposed to be treated with respect. Not only were we treated like street rats, our food was severely late, the order was messed up, and my pregnant wife was basically asked to leave a tip and get out. I wouldn't come here again if this was the last thai place left on earth.|Maaan do I enjoy eating at Chabaa!! I like going with friends and taking my siblings here whenever they're in town, especially because of their location to boba shops and late night hours. I've tried the spicy wings, appetizer combo, Tom Yum noodle soup, Panang Curry, Pad Thai, Pad Si Yu, Pad Kee Mao, pineapple fried rice, papaya salad and fried chicken over fried rice and all are always so good!In my most recent visit, however, I was quite disappointed. I ordered the Panang Curry in addition to other plates and when it came, 1) it was in a small bowl and 2) the bowl looked half filled. I kindly asked if they can give us more bc it looked like there was barely any in it. The server took it back and said they can make more for $2 extra. Now what's an extra $2 but the plate was already 11.45 so to add more $ would total to ~$14 and I could not justify paying that for a small bowl of curry and some rice. I declined the offer so then the lady brought back some broth for free; that was nice of her. In the end, Chabaa never fails! Just acknowledge it might be a bit pricier, that's all.|I see such good reviews but so makes me wonder why I'm writing this crappy one... well for starters, this was a delivery order so I think with big orders the staff gets a bit lazy and more concerned with getting the order out, but lets stay focused on the problems with my dish.1. I ordered the Green Curry w/ chicken & shrimp.. the shrimp however didn't make it to the party. But the guest list , aka the bill was sure the have them listed. 2. That wonderful Coconut Milk taste that I love and expected with my green curries was also absent(there was the tiny,tiny,tiny hint; leaving me with a flavorless spicy soup with chicken. I'm almost imagining the chef with a teaspoon of coconut milk left in a can, pouring that in the dish and just being too freaking lazy to open a new can. So there it is,,  the 2 stars that are there are only because its my lunch and I need food... but believe me when I say with the options available in the city for Good Good Thai food,, this was Chabaa first and last try...|Oof. I don't know what the disconnect here is. It's Thai in San Francisco, and my aunt recommended it and I saw good reviews on yelp. But my experience... I was disappointed. The restaurant is decent. Clean, kind of weird lighting, but it wasn't packed and I liked that. But there were people there--Oh and I'm also that freak who hates walking through anywhere to get to the bathroom... So I didn't go. Because it's through the back/kitchen/whatever. The servers came by every two minutes until we ordered. I just got here, I was tired from the plane, and I didn't know what I wanted. And they clearly wanted me to... Immediately. And didn't seem pleased when I didn't. However, when my water glass was empty, they were nowhere to be found, and came back without filling it. I didn't appreciate that. And the big drawback for me... The food. We got the pad kee mao I think--which I felt good about because I saw a tip on yelp saying it was good... We also got the pork larb with pork skin. So, did I order wrong? Because the pad kee mao was weird. The green beans were barely cooked at all... even a little, and it had an odd sweetness to it. The larb... Run, don't walk away from this dish. It smelled real funky. My brother (whose hobby is cooking) can make larb at home 10x better than theirs. I don't know what I expected from the pork skin, but yuck, gross; I did not have fun. It was so offensive to my aunt that she put her serving back... I was hungrier, so I kept trying for a few minutes. Not sure what to say here. Was this great Thai food and I actually have never had good Thai food so I don't know? I would hate to make that assumption. Sorry all--I won't be back.|I was craving Thai and decided to order delivery for dinner last Thursday," May 19th. Used Caviar to order from Chabaa Thai since they don't charge a delivery fee for this restaurant. I placed my ordered at 6:26pm and it arrived at 7:05pm. I live in Outer Richmond.*Papaya Salad """"Som Tum"""": Green papaya salad with tomatoes", green beans, and dried shrimp seasoning with spicy lime dressing, no ground peanuts, Served on a bed of lettuce ($8.45)*Tom Yum Soup: Hot and sour soup with mushrooms, tomatoes, lemongrass, galanga (from the ginger family), and limejuice ($8.95), with Shrimp (+$1.50)*Roast Duck Fried Rice: Fried rice with boneless roast duck, egg, onions, tomatoes, and crab paste, Topped with cilantro and cucumber ($10.45)*Pad Thai: Stir fried rice stick noodles, dried shrimp seasoning, bean curd, egg, bean sprouts, chives, no ground peanuts with Chicken ($8.95)The tom yum was the best dish and that wasn't saying much. Everything was rather bland. The soup at least had a contrast of sweet, savory with a little spice. The duck fried rice was second. Had some flavor from the duck, but the rice was rather mushy. The pad thai had the same issue. Was overcooked and a little on the sweet side. Maybe too much tamarind? The papaya salad was awful! I ask for this extra spicy and there was no spice. I also noted no peanuts, but there they were! Thank goodness it wasn't ground or crushed. Most of them were whole peanuts, so I could pick them out.Very disappointing dinner. The flavors I love in Thai food were just absent here. You can definitely find better Thai food in the Avenues.|The dishes were awesome, their pad Thai has lots of shrimps which were fresh and with a good amount! And if you are the eggplants person u must order their eggplants  !!!yummy The service was also good! Can't wait for dessert!!! Mango sticky rice of course!!! which are also amazing!!!!|Ate late lunch here. Street meter parking. Entrees ordered tasted authentic Thai. Beef Kee Mal had basil flavor with hint of chili. Chopped beef and not hamburger. Appetizer combination was very good. Dipping sauces were sweeter than I liked," usually I like the more sweet vinegar flavors in sauces.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sai Jai Thai Restaurant	""|Dish: Angel WingsCost: $9.50Rating: 3.75/5Review: I had no idea when we ordered angel wings that they wouldn't be actual bone-in wings. However"," it was pretty decent. I should've read the description because it said """"Stuffed chicken wings with silver noodles", minced chicken," black mushroom. Served with sweet and sour sauce"""" whoops!  Does anyone else just automatically order things from the menu based on your normal orders even when you're at a new restaurant? No? Just me? :D Anyway", this spot was good but not the best I've had but I've only been here once. We also ordered pad Thai and chicken with eggplant which were both pretty good but not the tastiest I've had.Located in Tenderloin, it was a bit busy for lunch on a Monday. Would come back if I'm in the area!|In love the the Green Curry. Second time eating here, and I can say this was probably the best curry I have ever had. Green Curry- My dad got the Green Curry, and usually I'm not the biggest fan of curry, but once I had a bite, I was hooked. The curry was sweet and creamy. The coconut made it perfect, adding a milkiness to the chicken. I just wish the portion was larger otherwise, this would be the perfect dish.10/10 would order this again, and 10/10 would recommend.|We got their famous grilled pork shoulder fried rice and cat fish mango salad. Pork shoulder's texture came out crunchy and a tad chewy, which if you have eaten authentic thai food at all, meaning it's PERFECT! Although, the marinade could use more flavors.  I feel like this special pork shoulder dish is good, but kinda of underwhelming. Could be improved. Cat fish mango salad is actually the crumps of the meat of the cat fish, fried until crunchy and packed together to make a big bird nest. Very very addicting, authentic (just like in Thailand) and delicious. Mango salad is, however very very sour. I felt like sourness is the only tone that came out which wasn't supported by any other notes (salty, sweet, savory ect...) I'd highly recommend you tell them not to make it toooo sour for any of your salad dish. There was a whole bowl of pure lime juice remained after we finish the salad. Overall," I will return for the price point and authenticity of the place.|I ordered """"Som Tum"""" with raw crab (Green Papaya Salad with raw crab).the salad was good"," full of flavors and the portion was good.what I really like about their papaya salad was the ingredients were really fresh.the Thai eggplants and the snake beans were crunchy it added the texture to the already fresh and crunchy salad.juicy cherry tomatoes.I also ordered """"Kao Pad Kor Moo Yang"""" Fried rice topped with grilled pork shoulder. Served with signature hot sauce.the fried rice was bland"," the hot sauce was salty and the pork shoulder was good but not as good as they claim to be.I had better pork shoulders in few other places.I can tell you three restaurants within one block from this place that serves much better pork shoulder.I also ordered """"sweet mango & sticky rice"""".good sticky rice with the sweet coconut sauce", but it's also pretty average as any other Thai / Isaan / Lao Restaurants will either serves you as good as this place or even better.they charged me $1.50 for hot tea that was not even hot.I took a sip and put it aside.is it a hole in the wall restaurant?yes, it is.cheap?yes, for sure.worthy a second visit?not a chance.|This place was very meh. We got the grilled pork, roast duck, tom yum soup, pad se ew, green curry, and fried rice with fried pork.The best item was the grilled pork. The flavoring was unlike others I've had before. Really tender and flavorful. The roast duck was also really good. I felt like the ratio of meat to fat was too much in favor of the fat though. There just wasn't enough meat park of this dish.The pad se ew...0 flavor. The green curry, just no flavor either. The fried rice with pork was pretty good. Not that hard to make good fried rice, so not saying too much there. The pork was a veryyyy thin layer so you're basically just eating half batter and half pork|The two blocks stretch between O'Farrell and Eddie in Tenderloin has six Thai restaurants to choose from, so after trying Lers Ros, Pak Nam Thai Noodle Bar and Lapats Thai Noodle Bar, I decided to give Sai Jai Thai Restaurant a try. When I stepped in at around 8 pm on a Saturday evening I was welcomed by the strong aroma of grilled pork (Moo Yang). The restaurant itself was about half full with two large groups giving it a lively feel. The menu is standard for Thai restaurants so I won't go into the details. I decided to get the Beef Noodle soup ($8.25) to-go which as per the menu is rice noodle soup with sliced beef, beef balls, and bean sprouts. I had to pay in cash as I did not hit the minimum needed for using cards ($15 I think but I may be wrong).After ordering it was a 15-minute wait and I was on my way. I got two containers, a large plastic container with the soup and another small Chinese to-go container with the noodles which was a good start as it prevented the noodles from soaking up all the broth by the time I reached home. The noodles were fine (they had not clumped up) and the broth was very good. It seemed to be very close to the original as I can remember it. Overall, I was very satisfied with what I got.Price-wise it was pretty cheap. This turned out to be the cheapest among the restaurants that I had tried earlier. Taste wise I think Pak Nam Thai Noodle Bar edges Sai Jai Thai by a whisker so for all practical purposes they are on par. I will be back to try some more stuff off their menu in due course.|I was starving like Marvin. I was getting dizzy and hangry. I thought of turning into Godzilla to exert my wrath on the city. I felt almost drunk with starvation as I sped through the city like a maniac looking for a new cheap restaurant to give me deep satisfaction. I stumbled across Sai Jai just in the nick of time! There was a broken parking meter right across the street, oh thank you Lord!I didn't walk, but I ran my fat ass across the street almost getting hit by the 38 muni. I ran in an ordered the pork shoulder cause I knew it was famous from yelp plus they had a sign out front advertising it. I sat down, panting and sweating. Damn it why does it take longer than 2 mins to get found in this town??(fat man thoughts), the pork shoulder was ready in 5!I took a bite and immediately noticed the meaty season and thick fatty strong meat. It wasn't salty at all, my first intro to Thai pork shoulder, well done. After fat-swallowing three or four pieces, I wobble to the counter to put in an order of pad prick pao, the dish came in 5 mins, again, and I happily took a bite! Yum, ooh and ahh, what pleasure, such joy!!! I can not describe this dish because I haven't learned to use all of my words yet, but best believe this is the best Thai dish outside of Bangkok. There's a nice flavor that I won't even try to describe that leaves a nice slow burn in your mouth. You know, that really nice burn, like two hours after yo momma beats your ass and it's starting to cool down so you can sit upright in a seat again but you just lay down on your bed like a victim. That really good warm burn....|Sai Jai Thai is yummy, but not as authentic as they claim to be. It appears to be Thai operated, as the staff spoke he language. They advertised their BBQ pork shoulder, but I didn't try it out. I had the Yen Tai Fo, the Pad Thai and the crispy chicken over fried rice. Overall, delicious and affordable especially in San Francisco.The Yen Thai Food tasted like a fusion of Tom Yum soup and the normal Yen Thai Fo ingredients, less the white fungus. It's a hearty seafood noodle soup and at $8.25, I can't complain. For being a mash up of flavors, I really enjoyed it. Definitely have it again when I get a chance. The Pad Thai was okay. It was definitely missing something --- I don't know what tho.It was a mixed protein - chicken and Shrimp, which is really rare in restaurant dishes. You usually just get one! And seafood is extra! Again, super affordable, under $9. The last dish was the crispy chicken over fried rice. It appeared to be a chicken breast pounded and then fried - like a chicken katsu at a Japanese restaurant. The rice tasted like it was cooked with egg and some peanut oil. It taste great. Not amazing, but I liked it.It's affordable, and not bad. The setting is super casual and the staff were nice. Will visit again. Overall, it wasn't bad,  maybe the pork shoulder would convince me it's a 5 star!|Grilled pork shoulder. Please get it, do yourself a favor and come to Sai Jai Thai for their famous grilled pork shoulders. Maybe get a curry on the side, and pad thai/pad kee mao/pad see ew.Excellent food, good value, which compensates for the not ideal location in the TL.|Services was great.  Easy place to go to have a conversation.  Food was just so-so, not my favorite but they do have all of the tradition options.|I use to LOOVVEEEE this place, but not so much the last several visits. Service is minimal now that they've gotten so popular. Portions have gotten way smaller. Some food that I use to frequently order has gotten too salty... too salty that its not even edible. The only thing I really still like here is their infamous pork shoulders, but that is it. I've been disappointed one too many times, so I rarely ever go here anymore.|This is definitely a hole in the wall restaurant with cheap cheap prices! I happened to be in the area after having some drinks with some friends and stopped by for some food. It is located in the tenderloin area, which you could miss the place if you weren't paying attention. Tenderloin has a bad rep, but I didn't feel endangered at all and it felt like any other neighborhood in the city. I had ordered my go to ultimate favorite Thai dish, which was pad see ew. My friends ordered the fried rice and the pad Thai. I wasn't really a fan of the pad see ew unfortunately. However, my friends had liked their dishes better. Upon trying a taste, I can confirm that there's was better haha! The portions are very large though, so you're definitely getting a lot for your buck! I liked that they had the dry Thai spice, since that goes so well with every dish. It's a must try! The wait staff was very nice and would constantly check in on us or fill our waters when it was getting low. Overall, it was a decent experience for some cheap Thai food.|I wouldn't come back. But the food was ok. Nothing spectacular.|This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant. I grew up in San Francisco so my family and I come here pretty often. When I moved away for college, I couldn't find any thai restaurants that come close to this. I love this place and will always be my place to go.Food: The food at this restaurant is definitely very authentic. The food is rich in spices, strong flavors, and definitely uses a lot of fish sauce. I love it. They have a lot of assortment of food from appetizers, to soups, to fried noodles to seafood. Here are some of my favorites. In their appetizer menu, their satay's are pretty good and their Angel wings. For soup, we like the bamboo/fish soup that is on their special menu. Warning though, it is very spicy. So only order it if you have a big group to share it with. Since it is so rich and dense in flavor, you can only have a few sips. The larb is delicious along with their grilled pork shoulder. Also on their special menu is their fried chicken bone. Yes, it is bones and you might be wondering you can't really eat much. But I don't know. The way they serve it with there sauce is great! A couple things I don't like is that they charge rice per bowl. When you come to a restaurant with 20 people in your family... Rice tends not to be worth it... We spent  $25 just on rice. I wish they have a a better option for rice. Another thing is that, my family and I have been coming here a lot. And we noticed that as the years went on, their food portion got a lot smaller and prices went up. So not too happy about that either.But other than that everything was delish.|One of my favorite Thai restaurants in the city! Cheap, authentic, and a local hole in the wall. Sai Jai has a loaded menu with fried appetizers (like egg rolls and wings), barbecue dishes, Thai salads (papaya or beef salad), noodles, rice plates, soups, curries, and Thai-style drinks and desserts (like fried banana and ice cream). This wide menu selection (while seemingly long) is not overwhelming whatsoever and it's great that there's pictures on the menu to go with! When I go to Sai Jai, I usually order a Pad See Ew (with chicken or beef), Thai Iced Tea, and Fried Banana w/ Coconut Ice Cream - the perfect dinner combo to fulfill my Thai food cravings. While it does tend to get crowded, there's usually no wait and service is great and fast. Each entree ranges from about $8-12 per dish. Parking may be difficult; I usually try to find free meter parking (after 6pm) or Uber. Since it is in the Tenderloin, be cautious of where you park. All in all, I highly recommend coming here for some delicious and cheap Thai food!|The ratings for this restaurant seem to be love it or hate it. It's not hard to understand why after a visit. If you're looking for a posh, modern vibe to be seen or impress your date, this is not the place. If you are bothered by random scraps of trash blowing in the door from the streets of the Tenderloin, look elsewhere. If you think fish sauce smells bad, you should reconsider what you're eating in a Thai restaurant. This place is a true hole in the wall with delightful flavors and superb execution. The pork shoulder, as everyone says, is delicious. The sauce is salty and tastes better with rice. We asked what vegetables were available for the day and got a plate of stir fried on choy. It was like a Chinese stir fry, but better. Instead of plain garlic, the leaves were flavored with fermented black beans, lemongrass slivers, chili flakes, and probably some other flavors that were not visible. For a plate of vegetables, it was superb. We also tried the fried whole tilapia. The skin was perfectly fried and crispy. The sauce was tart and sweet and umami. Also similar in technique to a Chinese fried fish but with Thai flavors. Yum! Well worth a return visit.|Cute hole-in the wall, authentic Thai:It's a homey restaurant in the heart of San Francisco and it serves well flavored and delicious food. Only thing is that their level of spiciness was weird, we tried ordering something very spicy and it came out incredibly mild. I would recommend:- Grilled pork shoulder: complexity in flavors... it's sweet, but not overbearing, and it has this smokey and earthy aroma- Tom Yum Soup: nice level of spice on a cold day|As the other reviews say, this is really a hole in the wall restaurant. A locals' place.Our family wanted to eat Thai for lunch and was looking for a more cheaper place than those more expensive places in SF. Decided to give this place a go. We went on a Thursday typical lunch hour, around 12 and the place was pretty empty. We went with our family-favorite staple Thai dishes we always order first, the Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and Tom Yum Soup. Then as an extra we also order the Lao Pad, a fried whole-tilapia with a chili sauce on the side. We also ordered steamed rice, which is $1.50 extra for each bowl.The prices are all pretty nice and cheap for Thai food in SF area. I thought maybe the portions will be cheap too but surprisingly the portions were bigger than I thought. My favorites were the Panang Curry and the Tom Yum Soup. I personally love Panang Curry(like a lot) and I've never had bad-tasting Panang Curry. This place had just the curry I was looking for. Surprisingly the atom Yum Soup I've had here was the best I've ever tried so far. It wasn't too sour or too spicy and it had just the right amount of a kick to give me that Tom Yum Soup taste. The Pad Thai was good but I've had a really good one back where I live, so didn't really wow me. It was more on the salty/spicy and a bit sour side, I like it when Pad Thai is a bit sweeter. The tilapia was ok but I've had better. Overall the place is kinda rundown and not a real tidy place but the food is pretty reasonable and good for the price you're paying. Not coming again but was worth a meal.|Sai Jai Thai is the best Thai food in the city and Bay Area. (Edit: Thai Farmhouse Kitchen is tied for that spot but is more expensive for a better ambience.) It is a hole in the wall with legit food. It is not the place for a date night but if you are in for casual dining and good food is at the center of your pursuit, this is the place. Over several visits, my preference converged to Fried rice with pork shoulder, Tom yom soup," and Pad kra paw (minced meet).|Instead of Cooking .. I'd rather have my dinner here .. Authentic Home cook You'll loved .. It's not on the Menu but ask for the Crispy Rice Salad ... This one dish Id always come here for . Serving is huge that I have to ask for to Go Container for Tomorrow meal .. for $22 2 orders me and My Roommate? Where good for 2 days :)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thai Time Restaurant	""|This may be my new neighborhood Thai restaurant!We walked in and ordered chicken pad thai", chicken pad kee mao, and a thai iced tea to-go on Saturday night around 7:30 PM.  The restaurant itself is very intimate and cozy with very limited seating.  I would love to dine in one night.  The food came out fast, so we we quickly made our way home to enjoy dinner. Both dishes were so tasty and fresh!  We usually have left overs after dining on Thai food but both containers ended up completely empty.  PROS: - Taste, portions, price are A+- Fast service- Lots of appetizing specials, definitely want to check those outCONS: - Not sure if this is normal but I found a handful of tofu in my chicken pad thai.  Not an issue for me since I love tofu (and they cook it very well) but some people may not want it in their dish.|I think the first time I came here, I wanted to cry because of how long it took for the food to come out.I was really craving Thai food so the boyfriend and I decided to try it out. Small restaurant with small tables but it smelled amazing. Good sign so far. We waited a while for just menus and waters, but put in our order (three dishes) relatively quickly. Then waited... and waited... and waited. For an hour. I'm honestly not even exaggerating because the entire time, I had one eye on an empty table that was piling up with to-go bags and customers arriving for pick-ups. If they straight up told me that they honored to-go customers more than in-house customers, I would believe it.Don't get me wrong; the food was great. But worth waiting an hour for? Absolutely not.As a follow-up though, I did give this another try and placed a Yelp pick-up order a few months later. My wait time? 45 mins. The food? Huge containers. It's totally worth it if you time it right. Just have a snack or two while you wait.|This is my favorite Thai restaurant in SF! My friend and I came at 6pm on a Thursday w/a reservation, but it wasnt necessary at all. There were still many open tables.However, at around 7pm the place was packed and there was a long queue.Wait for food: 3 stars* it took around 40-45 minutes for us to get our food after ordering! And it was the same for other tables too! Very understaffed in the kitchen!Taste & portion size: 5 stars* pork laab - very good! Comes with cabbage and shredded carrots - was a bit sweeter than I've ever had it.* papaya salad -super yummy! But not spicy at all - tip: ask for jalepenos and pepper on the side -the red pepper is extremely spicy!* green curry - my favorite of the 3 - super thick and heavy with sauce! The bamboos tasted like they just added it at the end tho...* mango sticky rice - THE BEST MANGO STICKY RICE EVERRR. Omg the sauce is infused in the sticky rice to make the rice soft and just like I remembered how my mom made them. It's the perfect amount of light sweetnessAm so excited to come back to try more dishes!|Dear Thai Time, don't skimp the shrimp! I've been coming here for a while now, and the Pad thai with Shrimp consistently comes with only THREE shrimp. With tax and tip it's over $11 for 3 shrimp. I've had food cart food that was more generous for literally a third the price.That complaint aside, the taste is OK. Their seafood soup is good, would recommend that.|I only tried a small handful of items, but I can see why this a favorite local spot. I enjoyed the pad Thai, beef fried rice, Thai Tea, and mango sticky rice orders my party had for dinner. The pad Thai had generous amounts of plump shrimp although the noodles had a slight flavor of coconut. It tasted a bit unusual at first but the flavors all blended together once mixed. My favorite item was the mango sticky rice, which was one of the better versions I've had of this dessert! I'd go back for that alone. There were several unique offerings I would've tried if I were a bit hungrier. I wouldn't make a special trip to eat here, but if I was in the area I'd go back.|Very small location and very cramped so if you don't have a reservation, it may take a long time to get seated.We ordered the green curry fried rice and the pad see ew. A bit disappointed with both. The pad see ew felt like the noodles were too stuck on each other instead of more loose. The veggies had very little flavor and the noodles were a bit too sweet. The curry rice was less saucy than expected. Overall, was very underwhelmed with this place.|A local hole in the wall for cheap and good Thai food! Thai Time serves traditional Thai entrees like noodle and rice plates, soups/curries, and delicious appetizers - all under $10 per plate. My favorite dishes here are the typical Pad See Ew and Pad Thai noodle entrees. Pad See Ew is a Thai stir-fried noodle dish (similar to chow fun) with a savory and sweet twist. I really enjoy this dish most because it has the perfect balance of noodles, vegetable, and meat ratio. A must get! The Pad Thai (a stir-fried rice noodle plate) is also great for those that love tangy and sweet flavors. This plate can be a hit or miss here because sometimes, it's a little too saucy.Keep in mind this place is small, so it tends to get crowded during dinner hours. Go early or expect to wait long. Parking is metered around the area, but will be free past 6pm. I usually don't have a problem finding parking here.|I've only ever gotten takeout from here and I like it! Their noodle dishes are good and not too oily. I wish they included more meat though. Besides that, the portion sizes are pretty good for dinner takeout. Overall, the price is really good for what you get and I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for Thai in the Richmond!|Nice little Thai restaurant. We had a late lunch. I got a vegetarian soup with coconut milk and a lot of vegetables. My wife got a lunch special of chicken, eggplant and peppers with rice. Food came quickly and was good. I really enjoyed my soup - something I rarely find vegetarian. My wife enjoyed her meal that also came with a small bowl of soup. The bill was under $17 before tip. Very reasonable.|The place is cozy. The food was okay at the beginning... Then my girlfriend went to bathroom. While washing her hands she saw that the water in the sink was brown and kept coming in brown color. She waited but the water was still coming dirty. My girlfriend came out and told me to stop eating. She told me about the dirty water. I lost my appetite. We did not finish our dinner... The waitress asked if we wanted to take food to go. We said no. We explained to her that the water was dirty. We paid the bill and left. We don't know if this was used to cook the food.|I've been twice now and every dish I have ordered has been good. Whether it's the curry, noodles, rice, or beef salad, all are very tasty and they give you large portions. Located on a side street next to a very busy and restaurant-filled Clement Street, this place is a stand out to me in terms of Thai eateries in SF. Lots of parking in the area although depending on the time of day, you may have to drive around a bit. Warning: this place is small. 8 to 9 small tables max so this place is not good for large groups. Expect a long wait during certain times of day/night. They do alot of delivery orders so if you want delivery, you have that option, although if you are eating-in, the wait for food might be a bit longer as a result. Also, you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. Not that big of a deal but just a warning for those who didn't expect that (like me).|Very good authentic Thai food.  Seafood soup was hearty, flavors were perfect.  Red curry and Pad Mee Kow is an excellent.  Like being in grandmas house for Thai.|Food is amazing and the prices are the best in SF!  Usually the restaurants on Clement are all really good and reasonably priced. All of the dishes that we ordered did not disappoint and I can't wait to go back to try more. Like many of the restaurants in the area, it's a small spot. There may be 10 tables at most, some seat 4 and some seat 2. It could get crowded later in the night and definitely don't come here if you have a big group. When it's crowded it could be a little wait. There's a small kitchen and one stove so the dishes take a little while to prepare. All in all, this will definitely be on my rotation when I'm trying to decide what to have for dinner.|Beware: Online orders at peak times will receive a 60min ETA. Calling the  restaurant to cancel will fail because their staff are trained to tell you to contact the app vendor. Expect to go through the credit card chargeback process if you can't wait.|Everything we ate was amazing!! The customer service was great and the waitlist via Yelp was fast and easy!|Great little Thai restaurant, when I saw little I mean little.  You'll most likely have to wait outside for a table.  Food is reasonably priced for a great product.  LOL, my friends and I laughed because we all had to use the bathroom.  You have to walk past the kitchen where all these huge flames are going on the stove and we laughed if you have long hair, you can possibly singe it.  Haha!  Didn't happen, but it's that small of a space.|Amazing Thai Restaurant. The restaurant itself is very small and maybe holds 6-8 tables. Service is very fast and your food comes out hot and fresh. We started with the Satay for an appetizer and it was delicious and a generous portion. The restaurant is sort of a family style place where you share with your table. We really enjoyed that.  Service is prompt and the food is delicious. Everything we had was very good. Can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu. Don't forget to ask for the spice rack to add a kick of spicy to your food. Parking on Clement St is tricky, so just park a few blocks away in the residential area.|If you are looking to get in a cheap, delicious Thai Fix, Thai Time should be your go to!It was my first time here and I came around 5:30 PM on a Thursday. It wasn't crowded at that time, but by the time I finished my meal around 6:30, there were a couple parties out the door. The restaurant itself is pretty small, definitely for smaller parties (2-5ppl) because there was only about 7 tables total. Anyways, service is fast, food is delicious and CHEAP. My bf and I ended up getting 3 dishes. Each dish ranged from ~$8 - $10 which is really really good prices for quality food! We got the Thai Tea, Tom Yum Soup,  Tofu Pad Thai, and some type of garlic/basil fried rice = #66 with Pork (I forgot the name of the dish LOL). Thai Tea:  It was $2.50. It tasted good, but not sure if I would pay $2.50 all the time for it. I'd rather get boba down the street if you are craving milk tea. Tom Yum: I got this dish with chicken, and let me say - THEY GIVE HELLA CHICKEN. The soup tasted average, like any other tom yum soup. I don't think I'll be getting this next time though, because I was so full after eating it and couldn't finish my other stuff. It was flavorful, not spicy, had mushrooms, tomato, and chicken, really basic. But it came in a clay pot and the nice server scooped it into bowls for me so that was kinda cool.  Pad Thai: I liked this dish but it was little too much on the saucy side for me - which is weird because I never had saucy pad thai before. The tofu was yummy and fried and the noodles were a good chewy consistency. I also like how the peanuts were really small - so it had the flavor but not the crunch. The portion size was good for ~$8 that I paid for it. Overall, super flavorful but again the sauce made the consistency kind of slimy and too flavorful. Basil Pork Fried Rice: Really tasty!! I loved the flavor and texture of this. It really had strong basil and garlic flavor. The only issue was that the pork tasted a little off - so i just picked it out on the side. It might've been nothing, but still tasted kinda weird to me and I didn't want to take chances. Overall, still good taste and good price.WILL BE COMING BACK!!!|I tried this place because of the good yelp reviews, but my experience was so terrible that I would never spend my money here again. Ordered delivery and my food took nearly 2 HOURS to arrive," and I live in the neighborhood. I asked the delivery driver what took so long and he said """"haha"," very busy."""" Really? Past 9PM on a Tuesday night? The food itself is just alright. I ordered the Thai time fried rice", pad pak gra pao, and mango sticky rice. Good but not great, and not nearly worth the wait. The fried rice in particular lacked depth of flavor. Would not recommend.|So when is Thai Time anyways? -- ANYTIME. All the food here is really that good, and it's literally open all day every day. After trying a slew of Thai restaurants around the SF Bay Area, I find most of them sufficient at satisfying my Pad Thai cravings, but the only ones that really blow me away are Kin Khao (can't argue with the Michelin star), Farmhouse (hipster setting and unique dishes), and Thai Time. While the former two are bouge and expensive, Thai Time's prices are a steal. Lunch specials are ~$7-8, and dinner entrees are ~$9 and under $15.... which in SF gets you artisan avo toast and craft coffee.Thai Time has the vibe of a local small business, no-frills but clean and well kept. The setting features lots of traditional Thai decor in a cozy space. Note that with ~8 tables inside, the wait can be long. (Came at 9pm on Sunday with the wait nearly an hour; however there was no wait at 6pm on Friday.) The menu is huge, including all your Thai food staples in addition a wide selection of unique Thai dishes I haven't seen at other places. Making decisions can be overwhelming; when in doubt," choose from the """"Thai Time Favorites"""" to try their specialties. They also have a specials menu board posted. (+++) Angel Wings ($9.20): I've had this before at Cambodian restaurants", and Thai Time's version is definitely among my favorites. Not only are you amazed by the feat of how the wings are deboned (though note some bones at the tips) and stuffed with ground pork, silver noodles, and mushrooms; the delightfully thin panko crust and tangy sweet and sour sauce add nice flairs to create a very appetizing appetizer.(+++) Hor Mok Talay ($14): Looks great and tastes even better. The sauteed prawns, calamari, scallops, mussels, and crab are submerged in a delicious coconuty red curry sauce, all inside a coconut (!!) You scrape the sides to add more coconut meat to the melange, creating a scrumptious and multi-dimensional dish. Be aware that it's quite filling from all the coconut; that it's incredibly delicious and difficult to stop eating :x(+++) Green Curry Duck ($11.35): The green curry has the same aromatic coconuty tones, with more depth and savoriness compared to the red curry. We were also impressed by the seemingly endless chunks of meaty, juicy duck slices. (++) Ped Yang ($10.75): Same great boneless duck, served another way. Being accustomed to crispy roast duck, the syrupy-saucey version took a bit of getting used to. I grew to like the interesting paradox of such a thick sauce with such light flavor that physically smothered yet subtly augmented the taste of the duck. (++) Thai Rib ($10.55): A curry version of galbi. I don't know about the texture of the ribs, which were charboiled to very dry, almost like jerky. It's still quite good considering it's covered in the creamy red curry sauce for balance; just don't be expecting fall-off-the-bone braised ribs.(++) Pad Sai Roong ($9.70): There's something about the surface area and texture of the thin silver noodles that has a lighter mouthfeel than carby rice noodles, and Thai Time does it just right with a light soy sauce and a bucketload of assorted vegetables and shrimp.Portions are ginormous, but I suggest ordering more and taking home leftovers so that you can try different dishes. Not only are the portion sizes decently sized; the generous amounts of duck/seafood essentially make all other restaurants in SF look stingy.Other tips:*This is totally a raving review, but be careful not to hike up unrealistic expectations only to get disappointed.*Take-out available. May be most efficient if there's a long wait.*Thai tea comes with a very artistically (Instagram-worthy) folded straw wrapper.*We were curious about Thai Crepe and Hod Thai (pan-fried mussels), but it wasn't available on both of our visits. We were bummed, though the server explained that they take a lot of time to prepare so isn't served all the time.*Parking isn't impossible, just may take some circling around. There's a public lot nearby which charges the same as street meters (free after 6pm and all day Sundays).*Don't come in a huge group since the space is small. But do consider coming in up to 4, so that you can try more dishes. Note that the tables are compact as well, so eat efficiently to make space for the next round. TL;DR: Thai Time is one of those amazing niches that's worth coming back until you try the entire menu. Geez, this review makes me sound like a glutton," but Thai Time really is that good.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lers Ros Thai	""|Yay! It's good. Near the Davies Symphony Hall (SF Symphony)", so it's easy to eat there and then go see a performance. From I remember, it's a pretty popular place and I think there can be a line sometimes, but it shouldn't be too bad.Can't find it on the menu pictures, but when I went, my group got some sort of pork chop appetizer that was AMAZING. Probably the best I've ever had. So good. Can't imagine that they would remove it. Would recommend coming here, but not alone because there's so many people you would look so sad|So this review will not be about the food. You can read the other reviews about that. This review has to do with the fact that the restaurant charged my credit card more than what I put down on the receipt. Not a significant amount more, exactly $1.50. The amount is not important, it is the principal of the matter. This is a reminder to ALWAYS write the amount on your customer copy as well as review your CC statement. Especially if you eat at this place.|It had been a while since I had Thai food. When Lers Ros popped up as an office lunch option, I decided to it was time. Our delivery order arrived on Friday, August 31st around 12:15pm via Caviar.*Green Curry: Medium spicy green curry with Thai eggplant, bamboo shoot, red bell peppers, and kaffir lime leaves, Does not include rice, Cannot make mild ($14.95), Chicken (+$1)*Brown Rice ($2.50)I asked for my curry extra spicy and it had a significant amount of heat. Almost too spicy for me, but I'd rather have it more than less. The flavor was pretty good, but I like a nice thick curry. I know traditionally Thai curries are thinner, so overall, the consistency of this was fine. It still clung to the rice. I did wish they noted the curry came with carrots as I'm not a huge carrot fan. I ended up digging all the carrots out. Was left with half a plate of discarded sliced carrots as there were a lot of them. The rice was cooked nicely and had a good chew.Normally, I order a bunch of dishes when having Thai. Since we have a budget to work with on office lunches, I could only have the curry. Maybe if I had other dishes, I would have enjoyed my meal more. But based solely on the curry and rice, everything was just A-OK.|Came here for a lunch date with my mom and was able to order a lunch plate and share it with each other. Such a great deal and more than enough food to eat for 2. The lunch plate we got was one of the curry options! It include rice and a side. We chose chicken satay as our side. The rice was very soft and cooked well. Such a delicious entree! I also ordered the Thai iced tea which came out in a large glass so you definitely get a lot of it to drink! The ambiance is nice. Not too loud and not too quiet.  There is an option to also eat outside if you would prefer!! As for the restroom," it is set up for only one person at a time. Not that big of a deal though especially when it is not too busy. Definitely would come back and get the curry again.|Appetizers: """"Pork on a stick?

It did not disappoint! The place was packed but luckily we didn't have to wait. We ordered the sampler platter, pad thai, and a curry. Everything came out within minutes of ordering. The chicken was lightly breaded and crispy. The pad thai wasn't overcooked or over saucy. The service wasn't as friendly but they were prompt AF. I don't come to Hayes Valley often, but when I do, I'll come eat here again.|Love Lers Ros and have been a customer for years. My favorite thai restaurant in SF. Lots of vegetarian options and amazing curries.|Great Thai food and great location close to the symphony, theaters, and city hall. It's also nice that they take reservations on their website so I don't have to worry about being late to a show. My friend and I shared our meals and both were delicious. I will definitely be coming here again and recommending this place to others.|This place was really yummy! A friend and I got the lunch special and the pad thai with chicken. The pad thai was HUGE would definitely have been enough for both of us. It was really yummy, and not too oily. The lunch special is a pretty good deal, but I would not recommend getting the tofu and vegetables with peanut sauce dish. It was really bland and the vegetables seemed barely steamed. The yellow curry on the other hand was a great choice. It was really loud in here, which made lunch a bit unpleasant. I would recommend getting takeout from here. Price-wise, it was okay considering the portion size, but it is still far from cheap.|I bookmarked this place as soon as Ben F. told me about it... and have wondered about it. Finally, after a concert at Davies Hall, I got to try it for myself.Thank God we remembered to make reservations as we arrived for an early dinner--the dining room was filling rapidly and had a crowd milling around outside by the time we left. The wait staff were jabbering to each other in Thai and to the guests in English. Nice. The smells that greeted us promised good food.The food arrived in rapid succession, and was so good, I failed to capture any photos. Frankly speaking, I am not at all disappointed with this--the flavors, freshness of the ingredients (especially the sea bass), the setting... a.w.e.s.o.m.e!Lers Ros is everything I adore about authentic Thai cafes delivered in a modern, comfortable, efficient setting. And when you factor in the price point (downtown no less), priceless.|Local little spot near my apartment. The yellow curry with chicken was phenomenal. Kevin, my boyfriend, didn't think so, but I thought it was a perfect balance of sweet and semi-spicy. We also ordered the pad kee mow with beef. Kevin loved it, but I just thought it was okay. The noodles were good, but the beef tasted weird. It is also very spicy!No-go on the spring rolls. Do not order those!Overall, great place for the price, and we will be back in a few months.|I had the Lers Ros Special Combination with Grilled Chicken, Sticky Rice, and their Exceptional Papaya Salad.for Dessert I had Sticky Rice with Durian.I was so full & happy.thank you,(your neighbor who likes to sit at the bar)|Don't come here. Staff is the rudest I've ever encountered, their drinks are pure sugar, and their food is overpriced and less than mediocre. If you're looking for Thai food, actually not just Thai food but food in general, this isn't the place to go. I never write reviews but I had never felt so unwelcome before. Would give 0 stars if I could.|I had a fabulous dinner with amazing friends last night at Lers Ros. We started out with a Riesling which went very well with dinner. We started with a prawns & mushroom soup and rolls and pork shoulder. Then, came the entries. We shared black pepper prawns and asparagus & Pad See Ew with chicken.  Everything was delicious. The service was good as well.|I came here for lunch on a weekday right before New Year's.  I'm a regular at the 16th St restaurant and had been impressed by the original on Larkin. I love Hayes area so it's great to have a Lers Ros here!They had a number of lunch specials and the portions looked quite generous. Staff was friendly and this location has a light, airy ambience. I ordered the dry Tom yum soup noodles -- which is dry noodles topped with some sort of aromatic seasoning, a variety of pork with different textures (crunchy, soft etc) with lime. I love this dish!  It was tasty and a nice place to catch up with a friend over lunch.I felt the the flavors were a little watered down compared to the other two branches, but still good compared to other Thai options in the city.  So, 4* in the overall scheme of things, but knowing the other two are so good, I'd try to go to the other two branches if I'm seeking Thai food. But, no qualms about eating here if I'm hungry and in Hayes.|I definitely think that this place is better than the one on Larkin Street. And it is because of the location. This is my go to Thai place in Hayes Valley. The line is definitely shorter than most of the restaurant in the area. We loved the Tom Ka soup, really hit the spot. I've been here literally one too many times and the only dish that I wouldn't recommend is the blue crab salad (or whatever it is called). They served mango salad with raw blue crab & definitely a picky eater dish. I mean I eat anything & everything but that is the only dish that I cannot tolerate. Haha. I definitely recommend: + Tom Ka Soup + Crispy frog legs + Pork Belly + Red Curry + Pad Thai Price is very reasonable for the amount of food. ~$18/person (tax & tips) The service might be a bit hit or miss but I guess it's like that everywhere.|Great Thai place near Civic Center. It's in the nicer area closer to Hayes valley. Staff is always friendly and food is always fresh. Love their Thai Iced Tea and pad Thai|Great Thai food in San Francisco's area. Multiple locations. This one is the only one with outdoor seating.|Decent Thai place. Got the crispy pork and the Tom yum soup. The crispy pork was a bit dry, probably won't order again. But the Tom yum soup was pretty good," came in a large pot. Surprisingly they had a lot of """"exotic"""" animals on the menu like alligator. Would be back to try those dishes.|I like ​another location more than this one", but the interior design is better.  You should spend time on the ​menu, so much stuff going on," take a deep look at it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Modern Thai	|Got the Eggplant with rice lunch special (with tofu) for only $12! Really good portion size and very delicious", I have no complaints. Solid taste, and the dishes came out in about after 10 minutes or ordering on a Sunday afternoon. The others' dishes looked great too, and everyone enjoyed their foods.|In terms of trying to be fancy, I would say this place misses the mark. The food is average and not something I would rave over. For the price, this place can be better. PROs: 1. Big portion sizes2. Lychee Tea 3. Service was goodCONs:1. Scallops were a miss2. Prices are too high for the food quality3. Food was not authentically thaiIf it wasn't for a lack of thai food options in the area, I would have probably chose a different restaurant. The ambiance was lacking and not very inviting.|Came here a couple of weeks ago (4/14 to be exact). Walked in, it was pretty empty so I thought we'd be able to get seated and fed right away. Well, I was more than wrong.The young lady standing near the register didn't greet us. She saw us walk in, grabbed two menus and led the way to a table for us to be seated. She then walked away. So we're thinking, that was pretty rude, but OK.It was a nice day outside so I asked her if we could sit in their outside section. She grabbed our menus, again without saying a word to us, and led us to the outside section and tossed our menus on the table and walked away. She seemed annoyed that we even asked her to do something (mind you, there were only 3 customers inside the restaurant, including us, 2 of which were already eating). 10 minutes passed by... we didn't even get a glass of water. It's been 15-20 minutes now, and we've been more than ready to order our food. I looked at her, trying to get her attention. She looked straight at us, looked away, and continued chatting away with her coworker. At this point, we're hungry and fed up. We got up and left. She just watched us walk out without saying a word. Rude, much? 0 stars for customer service!!!!!!|Been here twice. It's an interesting menu with plenty of signature dishes that go beyond standard green curry and pad Thai. The lunch specials are a real bargain. You can get three courses for about fifteen bucks. It's a huge amount of food. Nice decode feels relatively upscale. As for the food, I was very impressed on my first visit several years ago. Today's visit was less exceptional. The tofu coconut soup was good and had lots of veggies. The tofu spring rolls were okay -- but nothing to sing about. The crispy basil chicken noodles were very well prepared but a little sweet for my taste. I wanted to branch out from my usual pad kee mao and these noodles looked original. I wouldn't order them again. But I'd still come back. This is definitely better than average Thai food.|The atmosphere and the food are pretty good. Ordered chicken satay skewers and pad Thai with crispy pork belly. The chicken is tender and I really like the sauce, however, the portion is a bit small in my opinion. I may come back to try their curry next tim|Well disposed staff and pleasant lunch buffet! The nourishment decisions are different and they give delectable tea which I adore most! Naan was great!|This is a great location near van ness but the slow service, higher prices, and the mediocre flavors make this 3 stars.Came here on a Saturday for lunch ans we were only one of two tables, yet still the waitress wanted to talk on her cellphone instead of help the customers.The green curry was watery and the Thai tea that was supposed to be free with check in was a pain to redeem.The rice was cold and I really think it was sitting in the rice cooker for hours.Skip this place. I really wanted to give it 2 stars but my friend said it was okay so I'll bump it to 3 stars.|Meh.Better Thai in the neighborhood (Tycoon, Lers Ros). You can even walk a bit further up Polk and go to Co Nam (Vietnamese). We went to Modern Thai because we were looking for another place that ended up being closed. The space is promising but the food wasn't very good and the service was pretty bad.We ordered chicken wings, V rolls (basically egg rolls), soup, red curry and dessert (exotic bomba). The dessert was the only good thing we ate. Soup was flavorful at least but a smidge too sour. Curry was bland. Rice portion tiny.Our server was super scattered and seemed confused.Won't be back.|The place is nice, reasonably priced, with very good food. Try their Singaporean noodles|Visiting from the East Coast - we walked in and we're amazing how good the food was! Service was quick, food was fantastic - fresh and flavorful. Would com back here any day.|I ordered food thru grub hub and it's 40 minutes late and the restaurant isn't answering their phone.  Totally sucks!!! I'm never ordering from this place again.|The food is blend. The order is wrong half the time. If you tell them they got it wrong, they will say it is impossible. I have been a regular, but I'm done ordering from them. Services is worse than food.|I've ordered for pick up from here a few times since I work near by. The food is good. Yesterday for the first time I decided to have lunch there with a colleague. The service was horrible. The server was completely rude and we felt rushed to order, the restaurant was pretty empty. And she seemed really annoyed or irritated that we wanted to hold on to the menu a little longer after ordering food to look at the drinks. She came back and asked if we were done, we said yes thank you and she took the menus. We ordered a shrimp tempura and she never brought it out, and tried to charge us for two margaritas when we only ordered one. I will not be going back.|Thankfully you can't really mess up Thai food.  I was walking down Polk St and came across this restaurant that has such a cute set up.  I looked it and it was nearly empty, and I was hungry, so I decided to stop in.  Obviously we were seated right away.  The inside was so adorable! I had the Thai tea - very good! -and the Udon Pad Thai - also very good! But the best dish is what my husband got which was the Crispy Fried Chicken with fried rice.|Ate here several times while visiting San Francisco. Very welcoming to all and great food. The red curry was delicious with shrimp as well as their fried wings. Server was very courteous and prompt. I will be sure to visit again if I am in the city|The curry was terrible. Undercooked veggies and very slow service. Would not come back or recommend.|This used to be one one of my all time favorite Thai places. Unfortunately they don't seem to have the same cook anymore. The Pad Sleng Hai doesn't use the awesome transparent half pipe mung bean noodles they used to use. The Catfish with Eggplant is no longer amazing. The last cook used some kitchen magic to keep the eggplant bright purple and the catfish crispy, now the eggplant is brown and grey and the catfish is soggy just like it looks when I try cooking this dish. The food is still ok, but nowhere close to its former glory.|I travel for a living .... while downtown San Fran ... I wanted some good Thai food! I must say this was the worse Thai I've eaten in a while...salty and the noodles were terrible... as if it's been setting in a pot all day! Wow! Never again!|So fresh, really high quality food. Loved everything- favorite is the pumpkin curry (spicy) with chicken and rice- but literally everything is awesome.|Quick Service. Ordered the Thai Green and Red Curry.

"Thai Idea Vegetarian	""|I am super impressed with this place. It was heaven for my vegetarian friends who could share from everyone's plates for once.Food: The Tom Yum soup was super yummy", very flavorful and the smell of ginger and the tang of lime did it for me. The see ew noodles were my second favorite, amazing stuff man. The Thai samosas were not bad either. In all this place nails it with the food.Service: The food came faster than expected and this worked out for us since we were famished.Ambiance: It is a small place tucked away next to other bigger restaurants but is a gem if you spot it.In-all: I am super impressed with the food at this place, wish I lived in SF to be able to go here more often.|Golden cauliflower you are soooo good. I could have filled up on only that for dinner. It's crunchy and delicious and had a lovely dipping sauce. My only gripe is the pad Thai, it had no flavor which was a bummer cause the rest was pretty taste including the samosas and the salad wraps.I would go back but the menu was a bit limiting.|THIS IS FOR THEIR TO-GO!First time ordering here and I ordered to-go:Ordered a veggie pad kee mao, spicy and it was made in a timely fashion. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced. There is a plethora of Thai restaurants in the Tenderloin, so which one do you choose? Good question. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, then this place is for you! They have mock meat (beef and chicken, don't worry, it's meatless) so if you're feeling up for it, you won't miss the meat ;) Very interesting idea as I love thai food!It is not that far from Market St. downtown, so it is highly accessible on public transportation. Keep in mind that it is not in the most safest of neighborhoods, but do not that deter you from getting your comfort food.Happy eating!|I wonder how many times the employees see people dashing through the restaurant doors to avoid staying outside in the Tenderloin for too long. It was pretty much an adventure for us to get there. My friend and I saw a lot of sketchy people standing near the restaurant. Luckily, it wasn't too crazy outside. No one was humping a tree or shaking their booty while standing in the middle of the road this time. Welcome to San Francisco, :P. If you can ignore all the sketchy (and potentially sketchy) people, you should probably try this place. I ordered Pad Kee Mow ($11.25) and made it a little less spicy. My friend ordered Roasted Duck Curry ($11.50) with Jasmine Rice ($2.75). Both the Pad Kee Mow and Roasted Duck Curry were delicious and very flavorful. The veggie meats actually tasted slightly different from each other. The Pad Kee Mow had a strong bamboo taste. The vegetables were slightly raw but were still seasoned. The Roasted Duck Curry was sweet and not too spicy. The amount of rice my friend received was pretty huge. Potentially enough for two people.The inside of the restaurant was clean but not the bathroom. There were a lot of flies flying near the toilet and toward my face, so I washed my hands as fast as I could. I recommend not using the bathroom here.I will probably come back here but only in the daytime and with other people. I don't think I will be Thai-erd of this place any time soon!|Best Thai food I have ever had! The waitress was super sweet and the restaurant is clean and gorgeous inside. We asked for recommendations and our waitress said we should get the catfish dish and I am glad she did because wow! Sounds strange to get vegan catfish but it is cooked perfectly and is nice and crispy with so much flavor.. I've never had anything like it! Also the Thai green curry fried rice was bursting with flavor! But the Thai crepe dish for dessert was INSANELY good!! The ice cream and strawberries with the warm crepe was one of the best desserts I have ever had. No complaints this place is magical!|Phenomenal curry. No, not phenomenal for vegannn curry. AMAZING CURRY ON ANY AND ALL SCALE!!!!The Pros:- Clean, date-y, candle-lit ambiance.- Good, courteous service- No wait - We came in around dinner time 7pm on a Friday and didn't have to wait for a seat- Their Avocado Shrimp Curry is an absolute must. I still drool at the thought.The Meh:- Located in the Tenderloin.. just be wary of your surroundings when you leave|Ordered pick up, was ready in 15 minutes. So can't really comment on service other than food came out quickly considering I also ordered it near closing time (sorry for being that girl).Red curry/ pad see ew is what I ended up ordering and I was pleasantly surprised by both. Although my carnivore friend who ate some of my food was like," """"Blah"," still tastes vegan."""" I was pleasantly surprised! The curry was flavorful and the fake chicken was definitely more edible than some other places I've been to.Loved the pad see ew. Definitely wonder how much sugar was put into both of these items because it was really good. Recommend giving Thai Idea a try if you need a break from meat.|omg such a great vegan spot", i really appreciate that when you order something with egg in it, the waitress right away asked is egg OK? so if you forget to say something she will catch it! The firecracker balls (sans the egg) are so delicious! Love this place!|I've come here on a couple of different occasions. I originally just had Pad Thai and wasn't very impressed, but once I branched out and grabbed some more dishes, I became hooked!AMBIANCE is small, yet comfy with a modern feel. The spot is in the Tenderloin, close to Civic Center BART and AMC Van Ness 14. I've come here with friends and by myself, and have had a good time. The staff are attentive for the most part and make sure food comes out efficiently. ORDERED in the past: crab rangoon, chicken pad thai, spicy catfish.FOOD is incredible! I recommend everyone try the crab rangoon (how is there not dairy in this?), and especially the spicy catfish- which has become one of my favorite dishes to date.RATING is a fishy four. Fortunately this spot is within walking distance of my apartment, which means I won't be a stranger!|Came here for dinner looking for something tasty for my vegan bf. Came on a Sunday night around 6pm and there was only 3 people here. The location is alright, a bit of a walk from downtown. Ambiance was quiet and calm with friendly staff. We ordered the pad Thai and a pineapple fried rice as they charge for a bowl of rice if you order the curry! -.- and it's  $2.75 for a bowl. - Pad thai: It came out in a nice presentation, steaming hot. Had a good flavor as I tasted the lemon. The noodles was good too, perfect texture and chew. The vegetables I wish had more flavor and was fresh (canned baby corn), green beans had no flavor as we did not include egg into the dish. -Pinapple fried rice: It came out looking alright.  The cashew and raisins really threw me off but it was good. The pineapples tasted old, as its been sitting out on the table after being poured from the can. The rice was good itself with a lot of flavor, so points there. My bf said it wasn't even hot though, didn't come out steaming. So I'm not sure if it was 100% fresh. Overall, it filled my belly but I was not satisfied after the meal. We ended up going to Ikes up the block afterwards.|This restaurant was literally right next door to our hotel, and we were way too tired to walk anywhere so we came here for lunch. They were pretty empty for a sat lunch, and the place didnt fill up till about 30 min later.  We ordered the tom yum soup, pad kee mao, and an order of brown rice. The food came out pretty quickly and was really hot and fresh. I added a few small spoons of the chili pepper to my food and it made it extra delicious and spicy.   The tom yum soup was a little salty, and you definitely have to eat it with rice. The pad kee mao wasn't salty at all and had a good flavor. I want to come back and try their fried dishes !|I first went to San Francisco in 2002 & during that visit made a pilgrimage to Eric Tucker's Millennium restaurant that was in the Tenderloin yet is now based in Oakland's Rockridge neighborhood.The Tenderloin is still the Tenderloin as it reminds me of how Times Square in NYC used to be. Times Square has changed yet the TL still has a gritty edge to it along w/ being a great place to visit if you are a vegan.There is Golden Era, Thai Idea Vegetarian, L & G for a tofu Banh Mi, & the energy of Millennium's legacy in the neighborhood. In fact it was countless visits to Golden Era over the last few months that have kept me from visiting Thai Idea sooner yet am glad I made the visit. Thai is always a good idea & is especially a good idea if you dine at an all vegetarian restaurant called Thai Idea Vegetarian. It is in fact an ovo-vegetarian restaurant that is vegan except for serving eggs & dishes can easily be made vegan be omitting the egg on selected dishes.The website link to Thai Idea on Yelp was down so the prices listed on Yelp were in fact higher than prices actually are here. Besides that rice isn't an additional charge as rice comes w/ all the dishes except if you have brown rice there is a minimal charge of around .50 cents which is very reasonable.Many of the dishes offer choice of protein as either: veggie chickenveggie beeftofuveggie shrimpveggie lambAs is the case w/ dining at a vegan or vegetarian restaurant there is too much choice. I decided to go w/ the Green Curry as my server recommended it.The Green Curry came w/ bell pepper, bamboo shoots, eggplant, string bean, baby corn, & basil. I opted to get it w/ veggie chicken. It was quite good & not too spicy yet spiced it up a bit w/ the spice condiments.I look forward to returning here again in the future.|Ladies always give the best service and food is amazing. they are a mostly vegan restaurant but do offer some vegetarian stuff. my fave is the bbq rice. becareful when ordering a plate spicy bc they mean business!!! delicious food, amazing place, great service and they offer late night delivery too!!|Me and my friend are visiting San Fran for a few days, from Santa Monica. We came here for dinner and we were glad to see that their menu have a lot of options. All the meals there are Vegetarian, and they can make it Vegan for you.I tried their soup and my friend had the Pad Thai. The soup was served in a big ball, its enough for two people.Overall very clean restaurant and nice staff.|Absolutely delicious!! Typical Thai fare with a few Japanese and Indian dishes in a very non typical manor...100% plant-based! Whether you're a veg-head or not, this place is definitely worthy of a try! Their use of plant proteins is so imaginative! Surely to impress anyone. All dishes are vegetarian with the option to make them vegan (ex. minus egg on pad Thai). Just ask! I started with some Thai lychee iced tea which was light, refreshing and delightful. For our party of three (with leftovers) we then ordered...Tom Yum Soup: I must admit I consider myself somewhat of a Tom Yum snob as I eat a ton of it. The bowl here was up there with some of the best I've EVER had. Perfect flavor. Perfect broth. Perfect amount of spice and basil, and it definitely contained the most veggies I've had in Tom Yum," that's for sure. Panang curry with """"shrimp"""" and avocado:The """"shrimp"""" blew me away. I've had my fair share of faux meats but this """"shrimp"""" was not only of the same consistency"," but the same shape and taste also! I'm so fascinated and highly impressed by this use of strictly plant based proteins! I also loved the addition of creamy avocado! """"Shrimp"""" Pad Thai:We opted to go ahead and add that delicious """"shrimp"""" to their pad Thai which was perfectly peanut-y", but not overpowering. Noodles cooked just right and topped with fresh shredded carrots as well as the bean sprouts. Great kiddo option and big enough to split between two littles. Service was topnotch Street parking was easy Atmosphere was welcoming and clean. Food came out remarkably quick and was presented beautifully. Prices were reasonable. I honestly have no reason not to give this place a flawless rating and as much as I do not like to repeat restaurants when I travel," I will certainly hit this one up again. The Bangkok """"duck"""""," ahi """"tuna"""" and """"crab"""" cakes are next...|I was SO IMPRESSED BY THEIR CAT FISH. please try it. One of my vegan friends recommended this place and swore to us that it's going to be good. As a meat lover", I was skeptical at first but thought, WHY NOT? This place did not disappoint. We ordered another meat dish and curry dish in addition to the cat fish, with brown rice on the side and thai tea. The whole meal was so tasty and fulfilling, and you can tell everything is of quality. However though. I HIGHLY recommend that you order the cat fish. It literally tastes like fish (and the texture too), but with less fishiness, why actually makes it amazing. I've only been there once so I don't have as much to say at the moment. However, I will say that I will definitely come back to this place soon. I recommend that if you are not normally into vegan food, come try this place anyway! Asian vegan food is very different than the american kind and I think it's totally worth a try.|Super exited to have tried this place as I was looking for something new to try near my conference and it was a Friday night and none of us wanted to fight any more crowds than we had to so this place turned out to be a hidden gem in a basically bad neighborhood.So first off if you have a car this is not the best area to find parking that is both safe and within walking distance.  I had first thought that the spots in front of the restaurant were available to park but after a period of time one of the servers informed me that the car spot was not available, wasn't quite sure who could park there but I appreciated the heads up vs getting some nasty ticket which in SF is going to be steep.  The staff also warned me not to park around the corner because she said there are people hanging out and they will break into your car.  Again thanks for the heads up.  I ended up parking a couple blocks away and removed everything from my car and it worked out ok.  So once you get the parking situation figured out the place is very modern and inviting and surprisingly not crowded or noisy.  The staff  are super friendly and helpful letting you know about the different dishes.  Was very happy with their suggestions.  We got the larb salad to start and it was incredibly good.  I have never seen a veggie version of this anywhere and wow they did a great job.  it was ground tofu with greens and lettuce and shaved beets and herbs with a super big kick of chili peppers.  Totally recommend this dish.  It almost can also be used as your side of rice as it really went well with the other dishes.  We also got the yum woon sen salad which is basically a glass noodle salad with veggie shrimp and chicken.  Again most places do not have a veggie version of this dish and it's light and delicious.   For main courses again everything looked great but I decided on the jungle curry which seemed to have a lot of veggies and it was a lighter dish not having any coconut milk.  The dish looked great and filled with fresh veggies and it went great with the rice.  I'm not much of an eggplant fan but it was really good in this dish.  One warning is the spice levels here are some of the spiciest I have had for a Thai restaurant.  I asked for Thai hot so just be prepared that if will get what you ask for. On top of that they will bring you all kinds of condiments to add even more heat.  I was pretty much asking for extra napkins.  Prices are very reasonable considering how fresh everything tasted.  They will also give you to-go boxes if you want to take anything home.If I lived in the City I'd be here a lot because there is so much on the menu to try and it's tastes pretty darn authentic to my American taste buds.  5 stars for sure.|Eh. There are some vegan spots that WOW me and go beyond a vegan substitute for something that usually has meat. Those are the places that convince folks that vegan food can be awesome. Thai Idea is one of those places that puts a placeholder on for the meat and convince people that vegan can be doable. Personally: I tend to be less excited about this type of vegan spot. The meat substitutes were... Ok? The flavors were... Fine? There are bolder flavors to be had in SF's Thai repertoire for those who consume fish sauce, but if you're seeking out a vegan version or wanting to try some meat substitutes: do it.I will say that I have never been this excited about brown rice before... Not sure which type it is or how they prepared it, but that really was delicious rice.|This is one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to. I ordered veggie shrimp pad Thai and one other dish I can't remember the name of but they were both delicious even the veggie shrimp. Unlike some other Thai food, it was neither greasy or salty. I'm pretty particular when it comes to going out to eat especially since I'm completely vegan and hate it when restaurants put too much oil and salt. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in town.|Stumbled in here while looking for a Thai place to do dinner, and since I'm vegetarian it seemed like a win. I found the restaurant to be small but nice. The ambiance was great and all of the food is presented beautifully. We had the firecracker sushi appetizer, crispy duck with tamarind and green curry with tofu. The food itself was decent - but I didn't really find any of it to be memorable. The duck was a strange texture (not very much crispiness to it, I was expecting a bit more) and the curry needed more coconut cream and spiciness to make it more flavorful and filling. The vegetables were undercooked and the curry was watery, at best. I would definitely give it another chance and come back, but as there are so many other restaurants in the city," I won't be rushing to do so.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ploy II	""|Ordered delivery from here. Food arrived fresh and hot", and in a reasonable amount of time. Soup had a rich flavor and was amazing. Spring rolls were not cut but tasted good. Restaurant didn't provide utensils or napkins.|Food took 1 hour in dine in.DetailWent to the restaurant for dinner with my friends (5 total). The lady took our order and brought us some water. Not sure what my other friends ordered but i had a pineapple fried rice. Don't want the review to be too long but basically from the time we entered and were seated i waited 1 hour for my food to arrive. I couldn't wait any longer so since my friends had their food come by one by one, i cancelled my order and ate the food my friends shared with me. Bad part about this was a lady came to let us know that meal was being prepped during our 1 hour wait. Basically food started coming in after 35 min or so. Lady did apologize at the end but i lost my appetite by then.|This review is only for delivery:There are a couple options in Haight/Lower Haigh for thai food, but I like variety so I try them all. I've only gotten Ploy II for delivery so I can't speak to the service or atmosphere. In regards to their delivery, it's speedier than most Eat24 places, delivering well in their window. The food, is just pretty average. Nothing disappointing per say, I am full after eating the dish, but nothing that makes me want to order it again next time I'm craving thai food. One time I ordered a Tom Kha soup (I know, soup to go is the worst idea) and when it arrived, the portion was huge! It lasted me 3 meals. However, the coconut milk started separating from the broth and the soup became slightly gritty as the consistency changed. There were also a lot of pieces of galanga? or what tasted like overcooked lotus root that were very strange. I wasn't sure if they were edible or not based on how they looked, but I ate them anyway and I have survived. With their pad thai and other noodle dishes being just average and me having an unusual experience with their soup, it'll probably be a while before I order from Ploy again. Or maybe next time I won't be lazy and actually eat in the restaurant!|There are a few Thai restaurants on Haight street but none as cozy as this one.Ploy II is located in a converted Victorian apartment and you feel like you are dining at a friend's house instead of a restaurant. The fireplace is still present (not sure if it still works) and all sorts of homey Thai decorations and random Christmas tinsel garlands adorns the walls.  I've taken a few different people here and they always ask me how I found this place.The food its typical Thai fare.  I'd recommend the Basil chicken or the Pumpkin Curry which is rich, smooth, and fills you up fast so you can always get leftovers.  I like the tables that overlook Haight Street for people watching, but they can be hard to snag if the restaurant is busy.|Fucking terrible. Seriously waited two hours for food. Then I had to make a scene to get my money back so I could go to another restaurant for food. Do not go here. I've never had such a terrible experience|If you weren't on the search for thai food or just to grab a bite in general, this is a place thats definitely easy to miss. A little walk up some steps and you're greeted by a cozy atmosphere that others might think of as cramped. I like to think of it as my grandma's lil' cramped, homey apartment. Same vibes going on here. With that being said, if the place is full, it'll get awkward to try to walk by other tables, with your booty lightly grazing the backs of strangers chairs. For the time I went, it wasn't a huge problem since we were the only ones in the restaurant. My party of 8 ordered our food and the whole staff seemed to disappear. We were seated right by the kitchen which we can directly see into and we saw everyone sitting around watching an asian drama and eating. Half an hour goes by. Nothing. 40 minutes go by. Then we see someone get up and start cooking and then all of our food comes out in 10 more minutes. Like I said, we were the only ones there, so the meal would've been more enjoyable if they didn't keep us waiting or at least pretended they were cooking by checking on us to refill our empty waters.I will give it to them that their pad see ew was some of the best I've had. However the crazy wait was not worth it, sadly, so hopefully it'll be better next time!|Tasty food, relaxed experience. A bit pricey but not bad for SF. I suggest the crab rangoon for starters and the pad se ew|We came to eat here twice this week and don't know why it's not busier.  The people we brought to eat with had lived in Thailand.  They were impressed with the quality of the food.  The portions are good and service even better,  just like in Thailand, gentle and patient.  We will come back more often as a go to place to get reasonably priced Thai food with great tasting dishes.|I came here on a Saturday evening to meet up with some friends. We were a party of 17 but my friend was able to secure a reservation ahead of time. They seated us upstairs in a semi-private room, which worked out well so we could still all talk to each other. We were split into 2 long tables. The restaurant is inside a cute Victorian house in Haight area. The sign doesn't pop out so you may easily walk pass it if you weren't keeping an eye out! They put their ginormous menu on the outside of door so you can take a peek to see if anything catches your eye before going inside.For my table, we started off by sharing some appetizers -- SPICY TOFU, FRIED TOFU, and SPICY CHICKEN WINGS. Both tofu dishes were very flavorful! I loved the peanut sauce that came with the fried tofu. But the spicy tofu was our table's favorite because of the sweet and spicy sauce that covered the crispy outsides of the tofu pieces. I think the same sauce were used for the chicken wings too. They left the tips of chicken wings on so it was a bit harder to eat, but still very flavorful. For my entree," I split the CRAB NOODLES with my boyfriend. Their portions are really big so I'm glad we split this! The noodles were tender and evenly covered with sauce. You could taste the """"wok flavor", which is hard to accomplish at home. I would like this even more if the crab pieces were bigger. My friends had the PAD SEE YEW (with chicken and beef), TOM YUM SOUP, SPICY FISH FILLET, YELLOW CURRY and ROASTED DUCK OVER SPINACH. We all pretty much finished all our food and were very satisfied. A few of us also got the THAI ICED TEA and it was sweet but not overbearing. Their service for our large party was good -- our drinks were refilled promptly and they didn't hesitate to bring us chili paste and other condiments when requested. However, the timing of the food was a bit staggered. At my table, my boyfriend and I were the last to receive our entree even though we ordered first. And our second table started to get their food even though they ordered 10 minutes after us. But we eventually got all the food and spent lots of time chatting to catch up, so the timing of the food didn't pose too much of an issue.Note that they automatically include gratuity for big parties. They also write out all orders in Thai on the receipt, so make sure you double-check if you received all your food orders.  One of our tables didn't get their fresh spring roll and a tofu dish and had to remind waitress to not include those charges, since we couldn't tell if they wrote it on receipt.I'd come back here again especially if I had a large group and wanted to eat near Golden Gate Park.|My favorite Thai place in SF so far! The food is solid but what I really like is the ambiance and feel of the restaurant. It's a converted Victorian house which makes it very unique, and reminds me of X-ing in Washington DC. What also makes the ambiance more unique is the Thai music and decor... for an interesting Thai-Victorian feel.I've gotten the pad Thai, pad kee mao, Tom yum noodle soup and curry. All are really good, the Tom yum is probably better without noodles though. Fantastic Thai iced tea and mango sticky rice desert. The main reason that I knocked off a star is because the bill was $96 and they rounded it up to $100. They corrected it when we asked but that seemed odd. Also, it's difficult to read the bill handwriting - nitpicky stuff.|This is my favorite place to get really authentic thai dish.  They just update their menu recently, my meal that i order was crispy chicken over garlic rice ( chicken 's so crunchy outside and soft inside , going well with garlic rice which smell so so good)  ,  and mussel pancake or we call hoy-tod  ( it's crispy and tasty , come with hot sweet red sauce)  . It was fantastic and remind me of my hometown.  I have brought many friends to this restaurant, and they all fall in love to this place.  If you are looking for original and real Thai food , Must try this place.|I found food here to be tasty and inexpensive yet quite oily.At $12.95 the lunch combinations beginning at 12:00pm through 3:00pm are reasonably priced and satisfying.At $12.95 I tried the Spicy Prawns and Corncakes lunch combo, which came with a cup of the daily soup. Today, it was coconut-based and delicious. The entre arrived with a generous helping of white rice. The Spicy Prawns were mixed with red bell pepper and green beans. Although they were really quite tasty they were swimming in oil. The Corncakes arrived fried to a light crisp with a sweet dipping sauce.We also tried the $12.95 Pad See Ew and Egg Rolls lunch combo. This was a beef and wide noodle dish similar to a Chow Fun. Also with soup but no rice or corncakes, rather Egg Rolls. This too was quite tasty and satisfying yet again overly oily.We may try the curries next time around they should require the use of so much oil.|Overall, a good neighborhood Thai spot if you're in the area. I have had takeout from here multiple times but this was my first dine-in experience. Based on the service, I am inclined to recommend it as a takeout spot over dine-in.I went with a group of friends and we got several items to share - papaya salad, pad kee noodles, eggplant, red curry, and the tom kha soup (all vegetarian). The papaya salad was decent but I don't think good enough to order again. I would recommend the noodles and the curry. I especially liked the cute fish dish the curry came in that allowed you to pour the sauce over your rice.The prices are what you would expect and fair by SF standards. They do have great cheap wine options. It was very busy when we went and the servers were definitely working hard, but there was just not enough staff for the amount of patrons. We waited a very long time to order, get our food, and pay, so if you want to eat at the restaurant, be prepared for a leisurely meal! We were happy to be seated right away as a party of 6 on a Sunday evening. If I am craving Thai in the Haight I would go back, but wouldn't travel from a different 'hood.|So...here we go....The food is very mediocre (literally had to beg the waitress for chili, salt, and lime). Then, 10 minutes later, they demanded we leave because of my small service dog. He's fully trained, makes no noise, and were told it would be fine upon arrival. Since I lived in Thailand, I tried to talk to the waitress about service animal rights, but it was a lost cause. Conclusion: the service is surprisingly worse than the food.|Great food & cute place!! The Tom yum soup is good & the shrimp too!! Chicken satay is YUM & the soup is delicious!!!!|Note: this is a takeout review. Maybe it's better for dine in, maybe not. Who knows. Idk if I'll give them another chance. Got takeout from here over the weekend. We ordered the calamari salad, crab noodle, salmon filet peanut sauce, and mango coconut rice dessert situation. Surface level, how amazing does that sound, right?? Ordered from Yelp24 and waited over an hour for our food to arrive. Honestly, with the amount of food apps out there, how has Yelp24 not gotten any better? All the other ones give you real time updates. Yelp24 gives you a countdown to an unreal time...sorry for the Yelp24 tangent, but maybe it was tied to the restaurant's take out issue as well. Said the food would arrive by 7:40pm (over an hour past our order time). That was a lie. Called Yelp24 at 8pm, and they said it was FINALLY on its way. Fine, fine. Warriors game night. I get it. Anyways, the food overall was not good...not like it wasn't fresh(ish) ingredients, but nothing had any flavor???? Starting with the calamari salad...it was straight up a handful of calamari pieces on top of two huge chunks of lettuce. Uhhh ok. The crab noodle had zero flavor...plus, where was the crab?! It was like a flavorless pad Thai without crab meat! Uhhh ok. Then the salmon filet peanut sauce just confused the hell out of me. Salmon was goodish. Peanut sauce was flavorful. Both things together? Tasted like both things were battling it out and neither won. Uhhh no. THEN the mango coconut rice...supposed to be the star of the show, right?! I couldn't even get past one bite. The mango was not right and the rice was literally a pile of mush.Delivery - 2Food - 2 (that's being generous)|TL;DR: fast, free delivery, yummy pad thai!Delivery: 5 starsPad thai: 4 stars (would love to try it fresh)Pad see ew: 2 starsWe ordered 2 dishes for delivery via Yelp's eat24 at dinner time, expecting it to take 45-60 minutes as advertised, so we were pleasantly surprised when the food showed up in 20 minutes! Also, ordering on yelp directly was super convenient. We didn't get any utensils though, so if you want utensils, you should probably write additional instructions on the order to ask for them! Wasn't an issue for me though. We ordered a pad thai with beef and a pad see ew with pork. I thought the pad thai surprisingly had a lot of flavor! It was honestly one of the better delivery food experiences I've had, because usually not having the food fresh spoils it. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the pad see ew. I usually love the dish, but I thought this one lacked flavor and was a bit oily. I didn't finish it, and when I reheated it a couple days later, it still tasted the same, pretty bland. I would order from here again! But I would probably just stick with the pad thai next time.|Definitely that little hole in the wall that I've seen, walked past, and didn't think anything of it. I decided to stop by and dine in since I had seen this place so many times. It's upstairs with windows facing Haight, and it's nice! It's clean and modern, and there were cute drawing and signs on the walls.The staff were super friendly and greeted me upon entry and made sure I wasn't waiting for anything. I had a seat next to the window, so that lunch time sunshine was PERFECT. I ordered the pad see ew (ik ik, basic af) and it was super good! Not too greasy, the noodles weren't overcooked, AND the coconut curry that accompanied it was amazing. I've definitely found a new go-to thai place in the area, and I'll be returning!!Food: 9/10Staff: 9/10Atmosphere: 10/10Value: 9/10Overall: 9.25/10|WARNING this place is ridiculously overrated. Let's talk about the food first. It was good, but all in all it was pretty standard thai food you could probably get somewhere else. Prices were pretty standard, nothing too crazy pricey. If I had no other problems with the place I probably would have gone back. BUT the service is absolutely GARBAGE. We were seated pretty quickly, however it took 15 minutes just to get water, then another 15 for them to take our order. After our order was sent back we had to wait another whopping hour long before we received our food. In what world is this service acceptable? We had seen other customers who were seated AFTER us get their food prior to us. When I asked a server she apologized and just said they had been busy. All in all, if you're here for lunch or something and there's not a crowd, not a bad place. However I would go other places first.|5/5 stars for awesome authentic Thai food! Crab ragoons, chicken satay, and vegetarian curry puffs all recommended for appetizers. Pad kee mao (drunken noodles), pad thai, and fried rice also all recommended. If you're looking for delicious thai food, come here! I've had Thai from many places and only one where I'm from back home in NY is worth the trip. This place is where it's at! Highly recommended. Also the food may take a little bit," but that's how you know everything is made fresh (it's worth the wait)""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Champa Garden	""|Champas is a staple for us when we visit SF. They have consistently good food at reasonable prices. There's metered street parking or free street parking if you can find them. We usually order the:Pad see ew beef or tofuChampas fried riceChampas wings- it's ok. A lil spicyFried chicken- yummyRed curry with beefSampler. A nice mix of appetizers to try. Thai iced teaHighly recommend this place!|Sadly the poor customer service coupled with incompetence by the owner (and the rest of the staff) means I can no longer patronize this small family-owned business any longer even though I would drive to a remote part of Oakland to eat at this Laotian establishment. We ordered delivery and after their phone conveniently not working during the 90 min following the phone order", I *almost* gave up 7/8 of the way through my instant ramen dinner since no one bothered to contact us that soup had spilled in the driver's car. I finally got through to someone  after repeatedly dialing and almost full from my non Champa Garden dinner. When I finally got through, the manager Lushi offered for us to pick up our food (which we originally ordered delivery for) and didn't offer an explanation as to why our food never arrived. When I explained that we had been calling and that I'm full from my instant noodles, the manager did not offer to invite me back another time. Pretty simple solution but no, I needed to suggest that as well as more than the rounding up to the nearest dollar--a whopping 16 cents--as reparations. I then asked to speak to the owner who exuded incompetence, immaturity, lack of experience, lack of customer service and an overall I-don't-give-a-crap attitude. He is very young and not motivated--not a winning combination. He has absolutely no clue as to what he's doing and shouldn't be running a business. It's actually all quite scary. Who knows what is in the food or what shortcuts they are taking at Champa Garden as they are too dumb to realize that's wrong. I can't trust a business or the people behind it who has NO BUSINESS running a restaurant.  STAY AWAY. PERIOD.|Super nice staff but the food is CRAZY spicy unless you indicate otherwise We got take out and couldn't eat any of it Tried to call but it kept going to a version voice mail saying the call couldn't be completed  SO AGGRAVATING !!!!!|Located in San Francisco's Sunset District, I was expecting truly authentic pho. Although what I received wasn't bad! It's right off of Ocean Avenue, serving abundant parking and a couple public transit lines. The space is beautiful. I went on a weekday at lunch and I was the only one in there for a little. I later saw that this is also a sports bar and that makes more sense. Red walls, high ceilings, and a huge window for great natural light.I ordered the beef pho. There wasn't many options for style, and they do not do rare beef. I liked the chefs use of garlic and spice. There was A LOT of noodles and I am not complaining!! The rice noodles were delicious. I did unfortunately find lip stick on my glass and wasn't happy with it. I took a Thai Iced Tea to go and wasn't too happy with that either. Seemed kind of watered down. The service other than that was great; they have very attentive wait staff. I don't think I'll be returning though.|The sampler platter is great to share or as a meal Flavors are well balanced and seasoned properly Price point is affordableThey do have a TVOverall ThoughtsA very good neighborhood establisment serving up good food at a reasonable price|8-20-2018Alright, I bow down. The lao papaya salad here is legit. Again, this is THE one dish I want to have on my death bed. To me and when done correctly, this dish represents family, a mother's love, and the history of a tiny landlocked country in Asia where food means everything. So, I have very high expectations when I see it on a restaurant menu. Today I had 2 orders, one at level 4 and the other at level 5 spiciness. (Do not go there if you don't like spicy). The portions were generous. The spice hit with beautiful flavor...funk, salty, sweet, crunchy cold papaya with a perfect amount of speckled green beans for flair. Well done," Champa Garden. This is papaya salad """"tum mak hoong"""" worthy of a nation's adoration.|3.5 stars but I'll round up because this is in my hood and they're doing a great job! Stopped by on Wednesday for a family dinner", we called ahead and made a reservation for 7pm, when we walked in there were plenty of seats. We ordered a few dishes to share: [1] Champa Sampler - fried egg rolls, Lao sausage, and crispy rice ball salad, served with rice noodles and a plate of fresh greens. [2] Pad Kee Mao - stir fried drunken noodles with beef, mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions. [3] Green Curry - this is the greenest curry I've ever seen and was heavy on the coconut milk. [4] Tom Yum Soup - tasty and had a generous amount of shrimp. Overall the food was pretty good, I would order the Champa Sampler and the Tom Yum Soup again. I definitely want to come back and try some of the other dishes on the menu. A nice addition to Ocean Ave.|Thai Laos food. Second time here. The food just doesn't satisfied my palate for some reason but review is 4.5 Star and my friends love it here. Maybe I'm just not ordering the right food. The service is awesome though. Kids can't eat a lot of food there so they were ok for the kids to eat their McDonald's there while us adults can eat other food. I forgot ketchup for the kids but they were very nice to serve thai ketchup wink wink. Really awesome staff. That's a whole star.    I will definitely come back since the staff is cool and their food isn't that bad. Maybe I'll try their other dishes and prob ask for recommendations this time.|I happily came here after Bangkok garden in Daly City acted like they didn't want me there. Thank God I did. This place has a young, fresh atmosphere befitting of the young college student filled, up and coming ingleside neighborhood! The waiters were young college students, there was fresh hip hop playing on the radio and I walked up to the bar and ordered a duck curry. It came in under 10 minutes in a nice, deep star shaped bowl filled with red peppers, eggplant onions and of course duck. They didn't skimp on the duck either and it was perfect soft yet firm and had a smooth cinnamon taste, perfection. The curry soup was just as delicious, probably the best I've ever had. I'm going to say it now: this is the best duck curry in SF, hands down!|What has happened to Champa Garden???  I've gone there since it opened and it used to be so good.  I took out-of-towners there over the weekend and it turned out to be embarrassingly bad.  We ordered Tom Kha Gai (coconut soup) which normally is filled with chicken, mushrooms & kaffir leaves.  Instead of a creamy broth the soup was like dishwater, the soup was absolutely filled with onions and we had to search for the meager sprinkling of chicken and mushrooms.  Next came the entrees of Curry, Combination Seafood and Drunken Noodles.  None had the pops of flavor that one expects in Thai/Lao food, but all were extremely spicy hot.  We tried to eat the food but it was so hot that none of us wanted to suffer from the guaranteed indigestion so it was left.  The waitress asked if we wanted to take home the ample leftovers but none of us did.  It was a very disappointing meal and a waste of money.  I don't know what has changed at Champa Garden ... substitute cooks?  Perhaps it's a victim of its own popularity as it was jammed packed, people waiting and they were turning over the tables.  However the quality of the food wasn't there any longer and regrettably I won't be back.|Liked this place more than the Oakland version for both comfort and safety.Larp Thai is a definite favorite here and I am partial to Duck.  I ordered a spice level of 1 out of 5 since I have a wimpy tongue.  Great flavors and textures.Also had the Fried Squid which satisfies the fried food craving.  Has two dipping sauces.Eggplant with Pork is also tasty here.  They cut their eggplant into BIG chunks.  Yes double entendre as I don't know whether small councils exist.Closed out with Mango with Sticky Rice which could have had more form in the sticky rice.  It was a blob of rice with sauce poured over the rice.Service was passable.  Parking can be a challenge.|Get ready for an exotic feast! Champa Garden is a nondescript Laotian/Thai restaurant near Ingleside in SF, and there are flavors and dishes here that are so hard to find anywhere else. Parking is a breeze, and coming in for dinner on a weekend, we were seated right away and started with the famous Champa sampler appetizer plate, which came with fried spring rolls, Lao sausage, and an amazing crispy rice ball salad, flavored with slightly sour fermented pork and scallions. On the side came fish sauce along with a platter of lettuce and herbs for wrapping these different appetizers--the crunch of the veggies was a nice refreshing contrast to all the other more savory elements!Next, we had the drunken noodles with beef," as well as the spicy and herbal Lao style beef larp """"salad""""", which consisted of slices of beef and tripe tossed with mint, cilantro, onion, chiles, and fish paste! The red sea salmon consisted of nothing more than scraps of fried salmon along with broccoli, carrots, and corn drizzled with a red curry sauce, but was tasty nonetheless. Perhaps my favorite dish (though not by much) was the house special--deep-fried pieces of catfish, which were stir-fried with creamy eggplant, basil, bell pepper, and a house sauce! Perfect for eating with a bowl of rice on the side.Overall, this is a fantastic restaurant for delicious," well-executed dishes from stir-fries to curries to """"salads"""" and beyond! The prices are unbelievable for what you get", but be prepared for the spice explosion!|Meh. I am a huge fan of Thai food so I eat a lot of it. Sad to say this place disappoints 9 times out of 10.The service is a hit-and-miss, and so is the food. It doesn't taste authentic and is lacking in the flavor department. I'm sorry to say, but I think this place is overrated.Pad Thai and Pad See Ew are usually my go-to orders, and unfortunately I'm always disappointed. It's bland and doesn't taste like what it should. I've tried numerous times thinking that maybe I ordered on an off day, but no luck. The only dish that is consistent and I enjoy here is the Champa Sampler which comes with Lao sausages, fried rice ball salad and fried spring rolls. I'd maybe come back for that and to also give this place another try, but with so many other Thai restaurants in the city, it'd be unlikely.|Fantastic food! Cute and sweet staff. A blessing to have something other than pizza and Chinese food in this neighborhood. I always order to go and the food is always hot when I get there. Restaurant is always busy it seems. I get the drunken noodle with beef, took an employee recommendation on the meat choice and haven't ordered anything else since. Also get the kao poont, vegetarian,  it's like the tom kha with more umph to it, delightful! Chicken satay is nice as well because the peanut sauce is killer.|We came here because we saw it was close to our hotel. The food is good. Everything is as it should be, but the chicken curry was really spot on! The papaya salad was good too. We got laos style because we like our food with that dank taste, but it was a very clean salad this time. However, the service was terrible. There was this guy that threw menus on customers tables and failed to acknowledge us when we asked for drinks. He even asked if we wanted rice with our curry and we said yes, but he never came. So we had to ask the nicer server (the girl) to get the rice. What makes it worse was that we were the first customers there, and there was only one other table with us. We had to wait a few more minutes for the check, but they never came, so my friend had to get up and get the check. The service sucks here, but the food is good.|We've been ordering delivery from this location for a few months now, and I am a fan of a few things. My favorite:Pad ThaiUnlike many of the other restaurants that slather a tangy sweet sauce on their noodles, this rendition is moist, slightly tangy with a hint of sweet. Much more what I remember to be Pad Thai. In addition, they provide a mat of crunchy bean sprouts, a reasonable amount of meat and tofu cubes.I also like the sausage and sampler platters that come with lettuce leaves, mint and cilantro. They are on the spicy side, though.Finally, I like the Thai style Larb with chicken paired with sticky rice. The curries are on the thin side, but they have a good flavor. This has become a very popular delivery option for our family!|Great compromise location between my friend in Parkmerced and me in the Mission. I absolutely loved two of our dishes (Sampler + Lao's Noodle Soup) but was gravely disappointed by the third. Order right and you will get a fantastic meal here!THE WAIT: None at 11am on a Saturday for two. They were pretty empty, surprisingly!THE COST: $38.06 before tip for 1 starter and 2 entrees. This was a huge lunch for two - we had tons of leftovers!MUST-HAVES: Champa Sampler, Lao's Noodle Soup (Kaow Paik). STARTERS* Champa Sampler ($14.50) - 5 starsDefinitely the best of the best! I loved the flavorful sausage, crunchy rice ball salad, and unique spring rolls. Plus this is just a lot of food.PAN FRIED NOODLES* Pad Kea Mow Drunken Noodles ($9.50, with shrimp +$1.50) - 3 stars. Fine, nothing particularly special.NOODLE SOUPS* Lao's Noodle Soup Kaow Paik (chicken, $9.50) - 4.5 starsExcellent! Soft noodle, soft chicken meet, great coconut soup.|This is the first time I ordered take out, just moved a block away so I was stoked to try this!I walk down, with my dog, who is a certified emotional support dog, so I bring him everywhere with me with no troubles.I walked in and was just told no I can't be in there.I then replied that actually he's a service animal & he's allowed everywhere i am.Next what he did was so rude & upsetting.the dude SCOFFED & then proceeded to ask me what my disability is!!That was handled literally the worst way it could've been handled.I was then rudely told to go wait outside.Real bummer for me because I would've ordered here like once a week, but not anymore.It's illegal to tell someone with a service dog to leave.On top of that they gave me half a wrong order.|The food is decent, and some dishes are very good. If you order food for takeout, you have to be militant and ask for your food every 5 minutes AND watch to make sure they didn't bring it out without alerting you. Every time I order out, I have problems, such as.- They bring out the wrong dish for you and then have to redo it- While you are in the restaurant waiting (and they know you are there), they very often bring out the food without alerting you. A few times I was told it would be a 25 minute wait AFTER I already waited 25 minutes, only to find out the food was ready and I sat for 25 minutes while my food was cooling and they didn't bother to alert meThe food is a 3-4 star rating, though.|Woah that papaya salad was spicy! I like spicy but even for me it was spicy, i had to pace myself a bit! My friend definitely needed her thai milk tea while she was eating it. So for those of you who are wary of spicy, just go mild. The pad see ew had a lot of shrimp and it was so tender you could eat the shell too. You could tell the shrimp was pretty fresh because the areas where they pulled off the legs was noticeable. Lots of shrimp is a winner dish for me!Nice service, staff was checking on us throughout the meal. We went on a Tuesday might which was a good idea because this place isn't that big and on Friday nights," be prepared to sit at their small bar for 2 people.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lao Table	""|Absolutely delicious desserts and wonderful ambiance. The lamb curry is definitely worth trying.The Thai tea is overpriced.  Tempting to dock one star off this review for the prices; however", the food is quite good so it's mostly worth it.My favorite dish was the Lao Sausage.  It was so good!The desserts are the highlight.  The coconut and shaved mango ice are worth it.|Amazing food, service, aesthetics and ambience!! Made a reservation for dinner. This place is also great for small or large groups. There needs to be more places like this in SF that have it all! Made a reservation and came for dinner. We got:- Thai Ice Tea - Lao Fried Rice Vegetarian- Spicy Eggplant- Chocolate Souffle with Thai Tea Ice Cream|My friend and I came for dinner and got the Grilled Calamari and the Garden Fish. The Grilled Calamari was very good and I would recommend all to get it. The reason for my 3 stars is the Garden Fish. For a $70 plate, our fish was actually overcooked. Also, the meats were all just okay, nothing amazing. I did not like the beef jerky. What I liked about the plate was all the fresh garden veggies to eat with the fish. On the side note, all the food is on a big, tall platter. I was barely able to see my friends face! Service was mediocre. Thai tea was bomb. Would I come back? I don't crave anything from here, but if a friend suggested to come I would go.|I have been here twice, so I will be reviewing both times I went. The first was with a couple of friends (Friday at 8:45pm) and the second was with my mom (Friday at 6pm). Both times, I had created reservations the day of. The restaurant is sleek and classy, but seating is definitely close together and the lighting is pretty dark inside. The first time with my friends, we started off ordering several drinks. I ordered the Lao Soda ($13)- with lime vodka and watermelon. This was super good, it wasn't too sweet and was balanced nicely with the lime flavor. My friend ordered the Lao beer ($7) and the other ordered a Mai-Thai ($13)- which was really good, sweeter than mine but still not overly sweet.For food we split the Lamb Zeen Beef Lettuce Wrap ($17.95) -made not spicy with minced beef flank steak lettuce wrap, toasted rice powder, and basil/mint. It was good portion, but the flavors did not seem all there for me (maybe it's because we said no spice). We also got the Khaw Kai noodles ($16.95) which came with thick rice noodles (so soft and good), chicken, peanuts, and a soy sauce with lettuce. The noodles were very flavorful, but I did not think there was enough of them and I wish there was more veggies in this dish. It is a small portion for what the price was. Lastly, we got the Lao Fried Rice ($18.95) which came with a fried egg and chicken wings which was a pretty good sized portion. It was a bit spicy and kind of plain other than the toppings listed above. Not the most favorited dish. On my second occasion, the food we got the Wrapping Vegetable Crispy Rolls ($13.95) that came with lettuce, basil/mint, and glass noodles on the side along with spring rolls with shiitake mushroom. It also came with a sauce that was supposed to be sweet/sour but was spicy. These were really good and crispy. I liked how they gave big pieces of lettuce and noodles to eat them with. We also got the Fresh Spring Rolls in the vegetarian version- which is with tofu instead of pork sausage ($13.95). A waitress was coming around with a cart of dishes that were $6 each and were 1/2 the portion of the the normal size, so we actually had got the fresh spring rolls in the regular meat version as well. My mom and I preferred the tofu version.We both really enjoyed the peanut sauce, but thought that the rice paper wrap was way too thick for the rolls.We ordered the mini lao fried rice with a chicken wing from the waitress going around with the cart ($6), and it was nothing special and a bit spicy (though probably not spicy for people who like spicy food, I just can't handle it personally). We also got the calamari from the happy hour menu and it was perfectly crisp and tender on the inside. To drink we split a Thai iced tea ($7) that came in this really pretty large round cup- it was very refreshing, but maybe a bit too much ice.For dessert we got the Cha Yen Thai Tea Jumbo Icy ($19), which reminded me of halo halo. There was jackfruit, blackberries, grass jelly, strawberries, and some other toppings over Thai ice tea that they pour on top of the ice in front of you. It was really good, my issue was that some of the ice was so frozen so you couldn't scoop it easily as you would with shaved ice. Overall, both experiences were good, but a bit overpriced for the portion sizes.|Service and environment are really good in here. It's my first time trying Lao food and they tasted fairly good! Highlights: Basil Chicken, Roasted duck rice bowl.|Food = bright, beautiful, and quite good! Service = what service?Our work group of 4 came here for lunch, with a reservations. I was really giddy looking over the menu, because everything sounded so fantastic. I tried to choose things that I thought would help me stay awake and alert (or at least appear to be functioning) for the rest of the workday, so I paired the grilled calamari appetizer with a side of papaya salad. The papaya salad was still a large serving for a side, enough to share with the table for sure. It was crisp and a little salty and sweet, but it could have used some more heat. The grilled calamari was stunning - the whole squid was beautifully presented on a board with live flowers. It could have been more tender but I really enjoyed it with the dipping sauce. But yeah, it took a while to order, and we sat around with empty water glasses for a while. One of our entrees never arrived, and our server never came back to check on us. When we finally flagged her down, she didn't really give a damn about the missing entree. We all finished our meals and it still hadn't arrived so we had to flag her down again and ask for it to just be prepped as takeout. I also wonder if the presentation of the dishes tries to overcompensate for the overall experience?|My friends and I were craving Asian food somewhere in SoMa near a BART station for a quick dinner, so we decided to to give Lao Table a try. I ordered the pineapple fried rice (no raisins), and my friends ordered the basil chicken and the Lao fried rice. Pineapple fried rice was pretty good and tasted similar to the pineapple fried rice at most Thai places I've been to. I also appreciated that they accommodated my request for no raisins.The basil chicken was very flavorful and a little spicy. The Lao fried rice came with fried chicken wings, which were delicious! Each dish was around $20, which is pretty typical for SF prices. Service was great - they came by to refill our waters and ask us how we were doing frequently. Side note: for birthdays, they ring a giant bell and sing! I was seated right next to the bell, so I was a little caught off guard by the loud noise. Overall, solid Thai/Lao place in SoMa that's a little pricey but still tastes pretty authentic!|Good food, but like everyone said slowish service. We ordered a whole bunch of things for the table:Chicken wings: An excellent start - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, my one complaint is that it could have used som sort of sauce Crispy rolls: I mean if you've had spring rolls before then this is nothing new. A safe and solid choice if you're unsure about what to getPapaya salad: spicy and refreshing, I enjoyed that it came with noodles and a whole bunch of other mix-ins like shrimp, herbs, some sausage thing, etcLaotian sausage: good flavor, just the right amount of spiceOysters: Who can resist the $1 oyster happy hour? Let me tell you, don't get enticed by this offer if you stop by; tbh it was probably our own fault for ordering oysters at a Laotian placeSpicy eggplant: hey we needed some veg, and eggplant is always a good way to go - home style flavor with a lil kickPork knuckle: a gigantic pork knuckle - meat was tender in some places and a little dry in others, although it did fall off the bone quite easilyLaotian fried rice: was actually anticipating this one quite a lot, but managed to let me down. It just didn't really deliver on the umami factor, and was a little too sweet for my likingCoconut dessert: bang on yes! The coconut ice cream was delicious and creamy and the warm sticky rice went perfectly with it.Generally a good experience, I would potentially return and try some of the other offering from their pretty expansive menu.|Showed up early and had a few drinks from their happy hour specials : Jameson julep and red wine. The Jameson Julep was too sweet for my liking and the red wine was decent. Everyone at the table kept saying," """"the food here is good!""""  Enough said. The food here is delicious. We had the papaya salad (Lao style)", lamb chops, fried egg rolls wrapped with lettuce, fried rice, fried noodle dish, and spicy eggplant. Everything was so flavorful and cooked to perfection. Even though I was full, I kept eating. I could not stop!|Wait/Ambiance: They always have Yelp reservations available, even day of, so I would recommend making a reservation. You could also just walk in -- they usually have tables available (you may have to wait 15-20 minutes). Ambiance is really nice with lots of colorful lamps, flowers, and lights. The restaurant is also conveniently located next to Montgomery Bart on 2nd Street.Food: - I've only tried the garlic pepper pork and the minced chicken basil bowls here, both of which are delicious. I love that the bowls are a decent portion with a fried egg on top. However, the dishes seem a little overpriced to me (~$23 per bowl after tip and tax), but the portions are slightly enough for 2 meals if you're not ravenous.Overall:- Service all 3 times I've been here has been slow, and food can take a while to come out- Flavorful food, but a little pricey|This place has good food and a nice ambience. Their Thai Iced Coffee is really great, you should definitely try it out. There is a smaller selection of dishes compared to other Thai restaurants, but they are all great!|Every single dish here is sooo good! Highly recommend!Will take all my Thai and American friends here. Service is 10/10. Will defo be back!|Great food plus not so great service equals an average three stars. I was in charge of a lunch group and we were limited on time and also had some dietary restrictions. Lao is close to our office and also fit the bill for everything we needed. I had a reservation and our table was ready right away which was great. We placed our order with the server after she filled our water glasses. After that, we had to flag down servers with water pitchers anytime we needed a refill. Our shared app of the fried vegetable spring rolls arrived looking and tasting delicious. A short time later, our entrees arrived... most of them. One member of our group didn't receive her entree and our server didn't even acknowledge that until we flagged her down to ask where it was. It was clear the order had been forgotten and had to be quickly made by the kitchen. We got it to-go because we were short on time at that point. In better news, my chicken basil entree was really large and very good. The shrimp entree to my left looked fantastic as well. If I went back for lunch, I might try sitting at the bar for more attentive service, since they were very busy in the restaurant. I'd be open to takeout in the future, as well. Not sure I'd recommend it for a seated lunch option, however.|Lao Table is gorgeous, from the high ceiling decor to the plating and presentation. Hence how I was able to take some gorgeous pictures - thank you thank you.The food also did not disappoint. I would highly recommend the Kurobuta Pork Belly - it was tender and delicious. The Tum Marg Hoong Papaya Salad was the right amount of spicy and came with yummy sides! I may skip the Red Curry Chicken next time - only because there's so many other delicious looking plates and this was just okay.The only thing that dragged down the rating (besides the chicken, which was a little salty and tough) was service, but I'd definitely highly recommend a visit!|First impression: really classy place Second impression: the cost is on the higher sideThird impression: the food has so much quantity, worth every penny + deliciousFourth impression: really classy place, as first impression is the last impression :pNice place for group lunch/dinner as well as date ;)|Wow. Amazing. Authentic food in a great atmosphere with awesome service. Can't get any better than this.|Loved this place!!!!!! It has a gorgeous interior and fun atmosphere. We started with the veggie spring rolls, so delicious and fresh. I had a noodle dish and my friend had the pho. The servings were huge, definitely more than we could eat in one sitting. The service was great, everyone was so attentive and friendly. I felt the amount of food and ambiance was well worth the price. They had a great cocktail list with a lot of fun and unique spirits. Next time we come back I can't wait to give the drinks a try! Definitely check this place out next time you're in soma!|2nd time here and although this is 100% treat yo self type lunch (price wise) it's kind of turning into a guilty pleasure...I'm less and less likely to actually go and sit at a restaurant for lunch, but I feel like I need to more! The entrance is a little unassuming but once you open the door the place is huge. Even though it's been busy both times I didn't feel crammed. My favorite dish so far is the Om Chicken. It's a clear broth curry! Super flavorful and like having a really hearty broth. Definitely ordering this again next time. The sausage app is good too. I'm wanting to try one of the fish dishes next time.Delish.|Highlights: perfectly fried, crispy eggs on rice bowls, grilled squid and ingredients tasted noticeably fresh, chicken & ginger rice was really flavourful and well done (A+ cus this dish can get super bland if not well done)Pros: -- easy to make last minute reservations-- popping but not overly crowded-- beautiful / grammable presentation-- food is actually delicious / all the classics you'd expect (ginger chicken rice, minced pork, fried pork belly, etc.) Cons: -- a bit pricey for moderate portions (~$16 per entree)-- as mentioned by others, service on the slower side, you have to werk to flag down servers|The food at Lao Table is actually not bad but I would not come back because:1) service is non-existent.2) food takes forever to come... Are they growing vegetables back there, fresh?My table ordered food that shouldn't be too complex to make - fried rice, pan-fried noodles, curry dishes, etc," but it still took over half an hour for the food to come. We then tried to get a dessert (the Mark Mango) which took another twenty minutes to bring out. I didn't anticipate having to spend two hours at a dinner where half of it was me waiting for food and wouldn't want to pay as much money as I did for such a subpar experience.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zen Yai Thai Restaurant	""|I've moved up to The Bay from LA recently. I was a frequent of Pa Ord", Hoy Ka, Ruen Pair, and Sanamluang back in LA Thai Town. I must say now that I've eaten at Zen Yai for 4-5 times, it's on par with LA Thai Town scene. If you are looking for authentic taste, inexpensive dishes, no fusion food or fancy food, straight from Bangkok scene, you come to the right place. Its located in Tenderlion for Bangkok street food authenticity.  You won't be disappointed.|Yummy yummy place if you want authentic thai food this is a must. Homemade Thai food," you need to come and get the """" boat noodles """" popular here. Just hard to find parking and be careful what you have in your car not the  safest place but the food is delicious you gotta come and try it.|This is a long overdue review for Zen Yai Thai.  This is my neighborhood Thai restaurant and I've been going here for over a decade.  It's one of the last restaurants that still serve good food at really affordable prices. The menu is vast and I really appreciate that they have several combos for those who want a little bit of a sampler. The chicken satay is my go-to appetizer and it really goes well with the pickled cucumbers and the peanut sauce.  Generally", I'd get one of the combo plates but I decided to get the seafood claypot at a recent trip. All of the dishes are solid. Thai iced tea is a must order.  The restaurant is nice and big but the service can be a bit spotty.  I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for some cheap Thai bites.|Arrived here around 7pm on a Monday night and there was no wait, but almost all the tables were taken. Parking was easy to find this time, but it's not always easy in the Tenderloin part of SF. We ended up ordering the silver noodle salad (medium spicy), tom yum boat noodles, and the all beef boat noodles both with silver noodles. All these dishes were super good and flavorful. The silver noodle salad was a bit too sour for my taste, but the spicy level was just perfect. The boat noodles were by far my favorite, and you cannot beat the price (less than $5 each! for the small size). Highly recommend the Tom yum boat noodles. Service was good as well. They took our orders right away and food came out super quick!I will definitely come back to try their other dishes!|Definitely a favorite in San Francisco. The flavors are solid! A little too solid - the papaya salad is a force to be reckoned with. Pungent! I personally haven't had it, but the table next to me definitely was chowing down. I'm told the papaya salad is a Northern version of Thailand, not what you would typically see in Bangkok. They incorporate raw crab to give that super pungent taste.The food here is affordable! About $9.50 gives you an array of noodle soup options. I had the Tom Yum soup. Sour and spicy definitely warmed my soul, especially when San Francisco chilly winds don't give a @#&$ about your hair, nor your soul -- all while sunny!|Although this place is In the tenderloin, don't let that stop you. A good authentic hole in the wall home cooking place. Noodle dishes and papaya salad are excellent! Be careful when you choose spicy level though because Thai spice is spicy. Medium is already pretty spicy. The waiters and cooks all speak Thai so that's how you know it's good. The one thing i would not recommend here though is the green curry. Too sweet and watery. Otherwise other dishes are Delicious!! Will be back|My friends are always talking about this place so my fiance and I finally came with them to try it! Double date in the city on a Tuesday night. Might be hard to spot but Zen Yai Thai is across from the Civic Center Inn if that helps. Metered parking around the area but ya know, after 6pm it's free.  Maximum capacity: 49I ordered a large beef boat noodles (flat rice noodles); other options include vermicelli/egg/silver or thin rice noodles. The soup was flavorful, on the sweeter side, a tad bit spicy. The fiance got Crab Fried Rice and we shared the Zen Platter which came with fried calamari, shrimp cocoons & a sliced eggroll. My friends also got boat noodles. Was surprised that the bill was only $50! For 3 bowls of noodle soup, crab fried rice and an appetizer. You don't get a huge portion for the noodles but it was a good size for me lol. Service was so-so but good food. They also have snacks for sale in the cashier area. Don't like to eat in the city often due to the bad traffic, parking and high prices but this is a cool spot.|Soooo good!! i odder Thai boat noodle, papaya salad, I love the test so perfect. I would like to recommend to try the food at this place. Yummy  I will come back  for sure.|This is our favorite Thai restaurant in San Francisco. It's hard to believe how inexpensive it is. They have kids bowls of noodle soup for $2.50-$3.00. Their regular prices ranged six dollars tonight dollars. Where can you eat in the city for that price? If you have never been to Thailand, it is very similar to style than ordering. They basically how are you to order any of the foods that are not on the menu. It feels like being in Thailand for a couple of hours.Our favorite is the crispy fried pork (moo kop) in the soups or with Thai broccoli (kana moo kop). We always order the fish cakes (tod mon pla) as well as fried noodles (pat siew) then experiment with other dishes. Never dissapointA bonus is at the counter when paying, they have packages of authentic Thai treats and spices.|This place is great! The boat noodles were unlike any other dish I've ordered at a Thai restaurant-- I honestly can't remember ever having something like this elsewhere.The broth is this really rich and dark beef broth. It's balanced teetering on the edge of almost too salty, but the flavors are so good. I definitely *almost* felt bad about finishing nearly the entire bowl of soup. The large portion is plenty filling for a dinner meal.You can customize what type of noodles and what types of meat you want in your bowl. I opted for the thin rice noodles, which are pretty similar in size to the noodles you would get in pho. Next time, I'd probably try the flat noodles instead so the broth clings a bit more to the noodles in every bite. The beef was just beef, not particularly memorable but it fit the dish well. The dish is garnished with what are basically chicharrones/fried pork rinds. It's odd, but I thought it worked well as a garnish on top of the dish. It's definitely a race against time to eat them before the soup makes them soggy!The best part? This place is so darn cheap. Every entree we ordered, boat noodles and others, were all generous portions for less than $10. Incredible prices for a great and really authentic feeling Thai restaurant in San Francisco. The catch? It's in the tenderloin.. but this place is well worth the adventure getting here.|This place came highly recommended by a friend living near SF. They have the usual variety of Thai dishes but the boat noodles were what the rage was all about. I like to sample a variety of dishes so the small boat noodles were perfect for tasting (you can order the large bowl as well which was probably 3 times as big). We ordered one of each:    - Beef boat noodle with thin rice noodles - dark and unctuous broth, a bit of a kick - definitely a must try.    - Pork boat noodle with thin rice noodles - same broth and flavor as the beef boat but with beef pieces instead.    - Seafood boat noodle with flat rice noodles - came out pink and tasted VERY vinegar-y. I wasn't a fan bc of the sour taste    - Tom Yum boat noodle with flat rice noodles - sweet and sour taste with garlic. this was average. Think tom yum soup with less spice and noodles added   - Chinese Doughnuts - came with a side of condensed milk for dipping. Try dipping these babies into your noodle soup (without the milk).    - Papaya Salad - fresh, savory, kinda spicy and packed with garlic and flavor!Place is great to try at least once but I left hella thirsty bc of all the sodium I consumed.|Came here hoping to their their chicken rice since a friend of mine said it was pretty authentic, but unfortunately that was a weekend menu item only :( Boo!Ended up trying their beef boat noodles which was super tasty and authentic. Their shrimp fried rice was pretty good too! We shared the fish cake appetizer, which went well with the hot sauce (beware, its super spicy!). Hope to be back some day to try that chicken rice!|I heard about this restaurant from my friend who said he liked it, so I decided to try it out. Once I saw the menu, I knew exactly what I wanted - the FRIED CHICKEN OVER FRIED RICE! This is probably my favorite dish to order when I go to any Thai restaurant.The fried flour part was very crispy and the chicken breast was tender. There was some flavor in the rice, but not as flavorful as other restaurants. Also, other places add a wedge of tomato in the rice, but this place didn't. However, with the price being only $8.95, I thought it was worth it! The food portion was perfect, not too much and not too little. I would come back here again and try the other dishes next time!|Went out of our way to find this place after a high recommendation from a friend and so glad I did! If you want authentic Thai food, this is the place - the music, the people, the spicy food (even when you ask for just a little spice) is legit. Had the phad grapow, the kana moo grob, and the green curry with chicken. All amazingly delicious. My only regret is that I don't live closer so I can come more often. I will be back!!!|I will gladly trek through the Tenderloin to eat here! I always order the beef boat noodles with thin rice noodle (the regular, not the combo, since I'm not a fan of tendon). Get these if you are looking for an intense flavor explosion! Every bite was steaming hot and delicious- the perfect comfort meal. I've ordered similar dishes at fancier Thai restaurants, but Zen Yai blows them out of the water.|Talk about cheap delicious eats8 main entrees + 1 Thai Iced Tea + tip and tax for 6 people was less than $85Portions are generous and flavors are deliciousSeating can be good for larger partiesThey take accept credit cardOverall ThoughtsConsider me sold on Zen Yai!|It's the most authentic Thai restaurant in San Francisco that I've been to and the prices are really affordable.There's a secret menu in Thai for Thai Boat Noodles, Tom Yum Noodles, and Yen Ta Fo. They also serve Jok (Thai rice porridge) on the weekends!I recommend:PAD KA PRAO MUU KROB: Crispy Pork Belly with Holy Basil and chilies. This is a legit place because they use Holy Basil instead of Thai Basil. Holy basil is more lemony and peppery than Thai basil.TOD MAN PLA: fried fish cakes with curry paste. These were handmade. Loved the bouncy texture of them.These are also solid orders:KUAYTIEW RUA: Thai Boat Noodles. These would be just okay if going by LA Thaitown standards, but we're in the Bay Area. I think the soup could be flavored more strongly with blood. I also didn't get any liver or blood cubes in mine!KEE MAO EGG NOODLES: This is like pad Kee Mao but with chinese egg noodles instead. The shrimp were cooked well.People here keep complaining about the TL. Honestly, it's not that bad. I walked to the place from Civic Center Bart on a Wednesday night and it was fine. If you don't bother them they won't bother you.|This place is consistent with other positive reviews on here. The restaurant is situated in Tenderloin so don't expect a fancy, traditional looking restaurant. However, it is a great place to go for an authentic, quick, good quality  Thai restaurant.They have a a fairly extensive menu, nothing out of this world just good, honest, traditional food. I ordered a beef boat noodle soup and the portion was huge, real feel good food I thought and I was happy with my choice as I'm a big noodle soup fan.The angel wings were super tasty with tangy, sweet, and spicy sauce. I also ordered Pad See Ew with crispy pork and I must admit, this place has the best crispy pork 2nd to the Thai places in Los Angeles. Another dish I got was the papaya salad with fermented fish and crab. It's very refreshing and has all the flavors of sweet, spicy," salty yet very balanced dish. The meal was really enjoyable. Good food for next to nothing? No wonder it was so busy!|Zen Yai has a dirty hole in the wall establishment deep in the Tenderloin. It's definitely worth the trek to eat their """"boat noodle"""" special.There's plentiful seating", and service is nice. It's just inconvenient A F because it's in the shittiest (literally and figuratively) part of the city. I ordered the:Boat noodle - fantastically rich broth, fishballs and an assortment of veges and meat. 10/10|When dining out or snagging takeout in the city, you expect to pay a pretty penny, particularly with delicious food of any variety, but this place is super cheap for high quality and amazingly tasty stuff. My favorite is the Pumpkin Curry, which will only run you a mere $9.95 for an entire large tub of curry (takeout), which includes shrimp, chicken, huge chunks of kabocha, red peppers, and basil. You can opt out of the proteins if you want a vegetarian option, and add in tofu, just make cerain to specify it upon ordering. But jeez, $10 for a large portion that could easily last you 2-3 meals, feels like a bona fide steal. Do it, your stomach will be mad that you held out on it for so long. -Thai iced tea and thai coffees have such caffeine kicks that just a few sips will send you leaping across rooftops. -FREE DELIVERY on the Eat24 platform! Yes, this sounds like a billboard advertisement but hey, if you're partying in the city at someone's house situated upon a hill upon a hill and you just don't want to walk down to the Tenderloin or walk anywhere in general," free delivery is the bee's knees.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jitlada Thai Cuisine	|Jitlada is a small hole in the wall that mustn't be passed up!To preface this review", my boyfriend and I just recently moved to the area and wanted to find a good take out restaurant...and we sure did! Obviously I cannot speak to the service because we got it to-go, but the food is so tasty, we definitely will be repeat customers.We ordered the yellow beef curry, chicken pad thai, and the golden baskets. Everything was so far beyond our expectations! Some of the best thai food I've had in terms of price and quality, and an added bonus - quantity!Definitely recommend, and 100% will be back. See you soon!|We got take out from Jitlada and the food was really good!We ordered the green curry chicken, chicken pad kee mao, and eggplant with tofu. I really loved the texture of the noodles in the pad kee mao. In the green curry, the chicken was perfectly done, I just wish there was a little less coconut milk and more green curry taste, and it's really hard to go with any eggplant dish so no complaints there.Next time I'll definitely want to try out the tom yum soup since that's usually my go to dish, but for now I feel like the three dishes that I got are a good sign that this place is a solid choice to go with if you're craving Thai food.|This was the best Thai food  I had in a long time even my wife who is Thai agreed.The service was excellent and very friendly. The owner  came out to introduce herselfThis is one Thai restaurant you should go when visiting San Francisco.|Here's a more traditional take on Thai food that's been a mainstay in J-Town for as long as I can remember, and we all know that's a long time. Actually it's been about 17 years according to their website with the same chef/owner, Chef Pai, who comes from Thailand where she learned all her cooking techniques. In other words, there ain't no fusion confusion here. Consequently it was never the 'it' place to go to among the Yelperati, rather a warhorse that has survived its semi-hidden location on Buchanan while fashion-forward ramen and BBQ eateries rise and fall.I came here after a long lapse since my last visit for a late dinner and found it empty except for one large, loud group of young Asian women who were grousing about the lack of quality men in the city. I told them they might have better luck opening Grindr accounts. OK, I didn't but I felt like sharing that 'Sleepless in Seattle' statistic where they concluded they had a better chance of being killed by a terrorist than getting married. But back to me as I ordered the $9 Bangkok Salad, a refreshing mix of greens, cashews, carrots, tomatoes, and cucumber slices, all of the ingredients tossed in a soy sesame vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/2Mg0Uos).It was delicious but not quite enough to stand alone for my pronounced appetite, so I ordered the $13 Sam-Sa-Hai, a plate of chicken, sautéed baby corn, zucchini, mushrooms, snow peas, red peppers, scallions, and cashews in their house special ginger sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2MkYc0Z). I think what separated this dish from normal stir fries was the piquant flavor of the ginger, obviously something Chef Pai has perfected over the years and hasn't changed since. And why should she? I don't think she's gunning for another Michelin Star like Kin Khao. I think it's fine the way it is. But jeez, get a Grindr account, will ya?FOOD - 4 stars...good, no-fuss traditional Thai dishesAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...would-be quiet spot except for the cacophonous gaggle of girlsSERVICE - 4 stars...very quiet and attentive despite the noiseTOTAL - 4 stars...I need to remember to come back more often|Thai food is always on my radar when I'm in search of anything flavorful and ready to hit the spot. Located in Japantown across the way from the Kimpton Hotel, you wouldn't think a quiet restaurant would exist in such a busy area. Oh and if you're not looking close enough, you can actually miss this restaurant because it's so out of the way and nestled between nail shops and an alteration store. I decided to order the Gaeng Keaw Wan, Green Curry with Chicken and was not disappointed. This was really delicious. Keep in mind that this restaurant is tiny and doesn't have much seating. Street parking can be challenging especially later in the evening, although there is Japantown Public Car Garage on the other side of the block on Post Street.|Located in Japantown on Sutter and Buchanan, this cozy Thai restaurant was the perfect choice for a last minute late night Friday dinner. Menu featured all the familiar Thai dishes -- curries, noodles, hot and sour flavors, and your choice of heat, mild, medium or hot.Favorite dish of the night had to be the pumpkin curry -- smooth and mild with just a hint of sweetness. Also enjoyed the Thai version of an empanada, deep fried pastry puffs stuffed with veggies. The chicken larb was just okay and the green curry with tofu could have used a bit more heat but two of our dining mates prefer mild so we kept the heat low.Friendly service and reasonable prices make this a good value. I'd come back!|This place is a treasure. Based in an unassuming block it's like you stepped into Bangkok. The flavors blend together perfectly and the attention to detail is immense: it's authentic in the best possible way. Food wise, the pineapple curry is killer and served in half a pineapple!! Every time I go I discover something new and delicious. Be sure to check opening hours, can be surprising.|This is the best Thai place in SF I've been to. If you come across this place don't pass it up. Their food looks exactly like the photos it's amazing|Solid thai place in the middle of japan town, this is a really small set up so be sure to reserve a table if you're coming with a large group or prepare for a wait!We had most of the different curries on our table the last time I was here and I can confidently say that they're all good in their own way/unique and different. Do make sure you read the descriptions since some are more soup/liquid than paste curries, but I thoroughly enjoyed all of them!|I recommend the pad thai and pumpkin curry beef. Super good.|Found this place while searching for Thai in Japan town and glad we stopped in!! Great seating for groups and great chill atmosphere. And the food... so good!! I had the Pad Thai and others in our group had the curries and it all looked so good. Good service, good food and a great vibe - definitely recommend!|This spot was really cute, I came here with a friend and the restaurant was about half filled the entire time. The staff was fairly attentive, but there was a time when my friend made eye contact with a server and they pretended not to notice. The staff was really nice and helpful when we asked for peanut sauce and hot sauce. We got the trout in banana leaf and the pad Thai. The trout was AMAZING- the meat was grilled to perfection and just melted into your mouth. The vegetables it came with were cooked in the same sauce the fish was covered with. We ate this with the hot sauce and it was really good. The hot sauce wasn't too spicy, but added just the right kick to our food. The pad Thai was our safe dish, just in case we didn't like the trout so we had something to fall back on. It was good but my friend ordered peanut sauce to go with it because he didn't think it was peanut-y enough. I thought it was good, but generally prefer milder peanut flavors than him. It came with some bean sprouts and shaved carrots on the side. Both dishes came with lime which we squeezed onto the fish. They also have two Thai beers, one is the Singha which we got and was a good complement to the fish and pad Thai. Would go back, the food was good. Their bathroom is inside the kitchen, so while walking by we noticed the unique and clean kitchen as well. Check it out if you can|Delicious food!! Loved the papaya salad because it wasn't spicy! It's hard to find a place that has good non spicy papaya salad. The pad Thai is also sooo good. I will definitely be coming back. It's a small place but we came on a Friday and it wasn't crowded at all.|Ordered delivery and the food arrived not very warm. I personally didn't care for the noodles. Overall I thought it was ok but I wouldn't consider ordering again.|Pad kee Mao is fire. BIG BOY portions. Kind of low key, hidden. Staff is v nice. Always satisfied on my Jitlada nights!|And much better than average Thai restaurant with a delightful host. Their duck is especially good as is the mango sticky rice dessert|Probably somewhere between 3 and 3.5 stars for me.  I think the biggest downside here for me was the price - it ended up costing about $26.50/person after tax and tip for 2 people, which is much higher than I expected for the food we got.  We ordered a soup, the pad see ew, and the evil princess curry.  The soup came out first and it wasn't anything too impressive for me.  I thought that there were too many inedible ingredients inside, and that filtering those things out might have made that experience better.  The pad see ew tasted pretty standard for me, and the evil princess curry was also pretty standard.  I was a bit scared of the spiciness levels, so we opted to get medium spiciness on the curry, but it wasn't very spicy so I'd recommend opting for a hotter option if you love spicy things like me!Overall, I thought the food was pretty average/OK, but the prices were definitely a bit high for the food quality.  The service was good and the waitress was really nice!  In the end though, I think I would opt for cheaper Thai alternatives next time.|Went in for lunch and ordered the ginger chicken. The ginger sauce was very refreshing and had a very good ginger flavor. One of the better Thai food places I have food at in a while.|This place is yummy! The food is so fresh and the staff is very friendly. The location is tucked away in Japan Town off a quiet street. It's really a hidden gem. I found this restaurant on Yelp and was initially drawn in by the delicious pictures of food, very impressed by their health score. I will definitely be back!|This was the best Thai delivery I have had in a long time. The delivery arrived before the posted expected delivery time.  The Pad Thai was still fresh and not dry when it got here and had plenty of flavor.  Yellow curry was also very good while it had mostly onions in it I still enjoyed it. Recommended delivery Thai!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"King of Thai Noodle Cafe	""|This place is a hidden gem! It is so affordable and it nests in a quiet neighborhood of Taraval. I got the vegetarian pad kee mao (drunken noodles) with mushrooms and it came out to a big proportion! The noodles were full of flavorful and of course", if you like spicy like I do, then feel free to add your amount of dried chili flakes. Also, the decor is so cute and it's a great place to get a bite to eat whether you are in the neighborhood or are looking for your Thai food fix. I suggest their Thai Iced Tea! Haven't tried any of their curries, but I am sure they won't disappoint. Bring a friend or two :)|Well...I have had great experiences at king of Thai in the past, however as a drop in customer and reviewer, I have to say I was very disappointed with my last purchase and overall Thai food experience. The customer service was lacking overall customer service and did not feel very inviting. That was my first sign. There was zero care for the customers time and money. The right from the get go," a phone call to place an was lacking any respect. """"What Do you want"""" then """"BY."""" Now I understand there is a language barrier with service at Thai restaurants such as this. Yet", I felt a bit at awe because even in a restaurant that has staff with language barriers, there is respect when communicating with a customer for a tip and possibly future business.  The food was terrible. I ordered one thing expecting a delicious crispy fried rice as I usually purchase as a friendly service to myself. Yet this chicken fried rice tasted like pork belly fried rice. There were no vegetables and the chicken was much too tough with the skin fried and little batter. This was gross to say the least. It looked promising, but I was very surprised by this as it used to be very delicious.  Restaurants such as this do change owners and chefs fairly quickly with much preservation for their customer basis. Yet this hasn't changed owners, seems frequent customers and gives little for the overall quality of their food.|I have been to King of Thai in various spots in the city like Richmond, North Beach, and Union Square. Now I have been to this one on Taraval in the Sunset. I went with friend T. I had green curry chicken as I often get at Thai restaurants. It was fine, but not stellar. It's a casual Thai spot. He had yellow chicken curry. T would eat at a restaurant like this for dinner after a day of work on his own, so now he has a companion like me if he wants.|Have been here twice now. We always come around or after midnight because this is like the only place open in the sunset that late. Food: I have gotten the vegetarian fried rice and more recently the vegetarian soup. Both were decent! Especially good when you are a little drunk haha. Props to them for having vegetarian options & vegan!! The food isn't AMAZING but it has some good flavor and gets the job done when you need a late night bite. Service: We have gotten seated right away each time and the service is very quick.|Tasty Thai food that's open super late! I'm very fond of this place. It reminds me of the nights when I used to be a high schooler staying out late on a Friday night and I'd come here with friends after getting boba from Irving. I've tried a few things from here. Pad Thai, pad see ew, fried rice, Thai tea, mango with sticky rice. All very very good but I always end up getting the pad Thai every time. If you're into eating tons of carbs, I really suggest the fried rice. It's sooo good! Even the next day it might taste a little better since the flavors soaked up in the rice. Mango with sticky rice looks a bit hard and under cooked, but it's not hard at all. warm and sticky and very ooey gooey. If you have a sweet tooth, try this. Pad see ew is super good wit shrimp. Chicken gets a little dry. It's slightly sweet, savory, just the right amount of broccoli. If you like a bit of heat you should try eating it with the red pepper paste. Pretty good. I love the portion sizes king of Thai gives. The noodle dishes can easily be shared amongst two ppl. There are plenty of Thai places in San Francisco but this specific location is the best and u definitely get a bang for your buck|Came for lunch with the family and ordered a variety of dishes. Started our meal with the Papaya Salad which is pretty hearty. Ample amounts of shredded green papaya, diced green beans, and ground peanuts were served over iceberg lettuce (I know the menu says cabbage, but it definitely wasn't). The spicy lime dressing was really delicious this time too, not too salty or sour. Next came our share of entrees. My runaway favorite was the Duck Green Curry. The curry was sufficiently spicy but was also deliciously creamy and fragrant from the addition of basil leaves. The bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and green beans were also still crisp when delivered. There was also an ample amount of duck. This is easily a definite recommend. I also recommend that you order this a la carte. You'll get significantly more curry. Just order a side of rice instead.We also tried the Guay Tiaw Lord which featured shrimp, ground chicken, calamari, tofu, onions, and a few other garnishes tossed in a sweet black soy sauce and served over flat rice noodles. It was again, very hearty. Flavor-wise though, it had a tendency to swing from just right to too salty for me. The tofu pieces which absorbed all the sauce was much too salty when eaten alone but when eaten with all the other garnishes, I thought the dish was delicious. It also had so much going on in terms of ingredients and textures. Definitely a nice variation to our regular Pad See Ew or Pad Kee Mao.As for the Pad Thai, I thought the flavor was spot on but the noodles were overcooked and mushy. And the Crab Meat Fried Rice lacked a fair bit of flavor despite featuring a pretty generous amount of crab (likely canned).All in all, I thought it was a very good," very filling meal.|It's a good place for after partying all night to grab decent pad Thai noodles. Its a not frills place in the Sunset with generally good food. I mean I've lived off Taraval for years and probably been here around four times. It's a """"go to"""" place when you're in need of good Asian comfort food.|We ordered medium spicy and it was so extremely spicy we could barely eat it. So beware! Food was just ok. Delivery was prompt and food was still hot.|I have been coming to this particular King of Thai since my high school days #alhs #mustangs and it has yet to fail memy go-to item is the pad thai", hold the veggies or the pad-see-ew, hold the garlic minimum for card is $12.00^hearing this I thought the prices have jumped since my last time here (years ago) but luckily every dish starts at $10.00 so bring cash if you can****and their telephone works too lol in the case you need to call to double check they close when they say they do (because Yelp can sometimes be wrong)|This cafe is big and it wasn't busy during dinner on a Wednesday night. Service is nice and they're very fast. My friend and I ordered thai style fried rice with pork, and fried chicken with fried rice and shared both. Portion for one is humongous. Very little meat, more rice than anything, and rice was bland. Each plate was at least $10-11 as well. I think the noodle entrees would be better.|I enjoyed their food and props to the chief, but the service was not what I expected. They bluntly do not want to show their hospitality and always seem confused which confused me if I'm in a restaurant or not. Felt let I had to leave and a stranger. Overall the food is good so I'll give it a 3 but service for me makes a place so I give it a 1. Oh yeah update your prices they are wrong!|Place is average! It's been a while since I've been here but the last time I was here I remember having their pad thai and it was not bad. The only downside to the pad thai was that I felt like the sauce was a bit watered down. What makes pad thai good is having a fine balance between the sauce and noodles but it was almost like there wasn't any sauce and I was having noodles. However the Thai tea was fantastic. It was more on the sweet side and its legit and freshly made. King of Thai noodle also has a huge variety on their menu as well. You will be able to try a bunch of delicious Asian dishes.|The food is pretty good and the delivery was ahead of schedule, but there were no utensils delivered with the food, and to a hotel late at night, so I had nothing but bare hands to eat with. Really brought down my experience of otherwise good Thai food.|Odered 3 items from them. Jut a word of warning about any beef dish. Stay away, I ordered    15. Pad See-Ew Stir Fried Noodles $10.00   $10.00    -Choice of Ingredient  --Beef, for $10., I spit out every slice of beef they threw in there, I could not chew it enought to swallow it, was that tough! Whatever you do do not order anything with beef. They must get the cheapeast cut & try to passs it on to the customer. VERY BAD MEAT!|1. Ordered pad key mau, they didn't have any flat noodles, ok so I said can you give me some extra chicken ?? Nope, I get even less than a regular portion....2. Second time there is hair in the soup3. Employees smoke, handle food bare handed, and give tiny portions of protein. ( it would've cost them no more than 30 cents of extra chicken to get a happy customer) Food is pretty good but environment and customer service is negligible at best.|Pre-cooked fried chicken and reheated. I watched. Noodles, are nothing special. Shrimp is mushy. Over-all disappointed but I was in a pinch. Belly hurts a tad. My fault.|Delicious food! Only problem is it's expensive and they skimp out on the proteins like I ordered the duck over fried rice and it only had a few little pieces of duck. I'd understand the quantity more if it were a lunch special or the prices weren't so high. Customer service seems good though|The food was tasty. Generally brown, and floppy. But, was quick, and plentiful.The service was polite, cheerful, warm and welcoming.I would go back here.|Food always comes out quick and is super flavorful. Delivery is also convenient if you're in the sunset. My favorites are the Penang Curry, Tom kha ga, Tom Yum, and the fried rice. They do not skimp out on the food either.|There are lots of good Thai places in the city.This chain is open late which makes it a definite plus. The other locations are better. This location's service is inexcusable. After ordering takeout on Eat24 and waiting the estimated time to pickup," we arrived at the restaurant where the staff lady nonchalantly and unapologetically told us that she didn't even put any Eat24 orders in because she was so busy.Mixups happen all the time especially for a busy restaurant on a Saturday night. But the attitude this lady had? Definitely special in all the wrong ways.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Khan Toke Thai House	|I've been to this restaurant years ago", but just this week I came back with a friend for dinner. The restaurant sets an ambience that makes you feel like you're taken to another world. First thing you have to do is remove your shoes so that you can walk through the restaurant barefooted. You're seated at a table so that you're sitting on pillows and tuck your feet under the table. We ordered Tom yum with shrimp. The soup was flavorful. A little more sweet than sour. More soup than ingredients. But definitely very good.We ordered the pad Thai with chicken. The noodles were delicious and flavorful. I love that it's not overly sweet. For our second dish, we ordered the choo chee goong which is prawns in Thai curry with zucchini, mushrooms, bell peppers, and coconut milk. It has the slightest kick of spiciness. Definitely creamy and perfect with rice. Or even over your noodles. And of course, we had the mango sticky rice to share. The sticky rice was served with coconut milk and topped with fresh sweet mango. Sooo good.I'd definitely recommend this restaurant if you're craving Thai in the Richmond district. A great experience with great food.|Awesome ambiance, authentic vibe inside the restaurant. Definitely an interesting experience. They even ask you to take your shoes off. Food: The food itself was mediocre. What I tried:Pineapple fried rice: Too salty and a bit oily. Does not come with pineapple shell. Green curry with beef: Beef was a bit overcooked and rough. Taste was on par with most Thai restaurants.Pad see ew: Again, a bit salty and oily. Service: Had to wait quite some time before we were seated as the restaurant is understaffed despite the abundant seating.   Customer service was also mediocre. The wait staff was not very attentative and it was difficult to ge the check at times.Price: Very cheap, especially for San Francisco prices. Bill came out to about $13 per person. Overall impression:Recommend because the experience was pretty interesting. Food didn't particularly stand out to me but was decent overall.|I actually stumbled upon this place twice during my time in the city. The first time was years ago. The second was this last week. Both times I was so surprised by the decor and completely amazed by the how authentic the atmosphere was. This time we came for a late lunch. There was only one other table with guests which I actually loved. It made things pretty cozy for my partner and I. Funny thing is I sat in the same place both times I dined at the restaurant. It was a one of the lowered into the floor tables near a window that looked out the back. The server who seemed to be doing midday prep/reports was very attentive regardless. The food came out very quickly and was super good. We ordered pad thai and a soup - both were very good! I hope to be back super soon as I now live in the area.   10/10 would eat there again.|Went here tonight for a birthday dinner in a group of 11! We picked the place because we were able to make a reservation, which was ideal. The atmosphere of the restaurant was particularly unique- everyone has to take their shoes off upon entering, so where socks if you don't like walking around barefoot. Then you sit at tables that model sitting on the floor. The staff was very average and the waiter seemed to really struggle taking the group order, but the food came out quite fast.  Two of my friends and I ordered a sautéed beef dish, which lacked flavor, pad Kee mao, which was relatively average, and the Penang curry, which we all agreed was the best dish we ordered! That is probably the only one I would order again! Overall, it was an average eating experience, and I think the Thai food in the sunset is better!|My favorite Thai restaurant to go to in San Francisco! It's on Geary Blvd in Central/Outer Richmond District. My partner and I love coming here especially since we no longer live in SF. We love getting their chicken basil noodles and their clucking chicken. When you see the outside of the place, it just looks like an ordinary building, but once you go inside, it's a whole new experience. Check it out for yourself! I don't want to spoil it.The decor inside is beautiful and amazing to look at. The food tastes delicious and there are so many options so if you come with a group then everyone will be able to eat something. It's good for groups as well, I have had my graduation dinner here and my partner's birthday party with around 15 people each. There are several separate rooms that are used for big groups. Their table set up is very nice. Cost is average for a Thai place ranging from $8 - $20 (depends on what you get of course!). Parking is street parking so wherever you can find it because of course it is SF. :) Overall, it's a great experience to eat here and the food is delicious! Chicken basil noodles and clucking chicken with a bowl of rice, Thai tea to drink and mango sticky rice for dessert!|I liked the ambience of this Thai restaurant much more than the food itself. A unique tidbit about this establishment: they have you take off your shoes before being directed to your table (where you sit on pillows and have a comfortable floor opening where you can rest your legs. Very much an Asian tradition that this restaurant embellishes into their atmosphere, allowing for a more welcoming, homelike ambience.Servings per menu item are sparse for family-style portions given here and a bit expensive as well. Also, the customer service here was alright; we had to flag down the server on a few occasions when we wanted to order another item or when we were ready to pay.Next time I'm in San Francisco, this Thai restaurant isn't on my top list for returning food joints, but perhaps one I necessarily wouldn't mind coming back to if I'm in the Outer Richmond neighborhood.|bomb.com!! This place was probably the most authentic Thai restaurant that I have ever been to! The entire dining experience is a plus in and of itself. They make you take your shoes off, and then you sit on the ground, but there's a depression in the ground for your feet - just a fun time! The service was awesome. My friend and I loved the colorful explanation of the aromatic, amazing thai hot tea. I went with Tom Kha + Green Curry fried rice - both amaaaZzzzZe! It's a ton of food, albeit a tad bit pricey.I'd definitely recommend!|For my company paid lunch last week, we decided to do take out here at Khan Toke. I ordered a chicken pad thai (no peanuts) and a thai iced tea. The pad thai had tons of bean sprouts (I took it all off for the photo below) and was A-OK. It was not a dish that I would rave about. Thai iced tea came in a decorative paper cup. I would do King of Thai Noodles or Bangkok Garden in Daly City.|Amazing ambiance. Really good food. An almost authentic Thai experience nestled in the city.(The only immediate con I can think of is the lack of parking. Uber/Lyft is best, but parking isn't too impossible with a good dose of patience/luck.)I came here on a whim - and was immediately delighted by the interior.SPOILER ALERT: (If you want to be surprised, don't look at the photos and just come :) The food is great, and it's a cool experience.For those who are still here... (giving you a chance to leave still...)You're immediately greeted by a friendly host, where you immediately see the ambiance everyone is talking about. You do have to take off your shoes, so that part is cool (but I can see how some hygiene-conscious people may not like this part), and you sit on the pillowed floor with space carved our for your feet (so it's essentially a chair dug into the ground). The main dining room has a chime-like song which sounds enchanted and magical (though it does go on loop so it might get stuck in your head, and the song doesn't seem to change from visit to visit). Intricate wooden carvings are everywhere, and it's just a really nice place to take a date or family.The Thai fare is typical - with prices being pretty reasonable for Thai + SF location. My favorite go-to is the Pad See Eye (it's spelt a little differently here though), which has plenty of noodles and a great taste. The BBQ chicken is not really BBQ to me - it's really really charred (I tried this twice and both times it's been like this), and the sauce is okay. If you don't mind some char and a bit dry chicken though, the chicken is pretty good!For dessert, we tried the mango sticky rice because it's amazing in Thailand. It's not amazing here, but I guess it's hard to match mangos from Philippines/Thailand (mangos in America/Mexico are completely different... and sadly inferior in almost every way. Since we're on this topic, bananas are also inferior. Enough digression haha.) Next time, I'll opt for the fried ice cream - the fast path to diabetes maybe, but also immediate gratification for happiness :)Overall, love this place and will be coming back!|Our family in SoCal and the SF area love Thai food.  This restaurant is a favorite of the SF family.  The Asian courtesy of removing shoes is nice and the decor ( except for the artificial flowers) is lovely. However, the meal is very average and the portions are rather light for the price .  The best thing were the appetizer sticky sweet chicken wings.  Pad kee mao was ordered twice because it was so skimpy. I suppose this place is known best for it's atmosphere.|Amazing food, beautiful rooms and low tables with leg space below! Peaceful atmosphere and kind wait staff. I don't know why this place isn't more busy, my mom used to come here 20 years ago and it was packed! It's fairly priced and delicious. Highly highly recommend for the experience and delicious food!|Came here yesterday for dinner to celebrate roommate's birthday. Had ordered Meing Com (Vegetarian), yellow curry and pad thai (vegetarian).Even after explicitly mentioning that meing com should be vegetarian twice, our dish had dried shrimp in it and the sauce of the dish also tasted like it has meat in it.Pad thai was horrible. Have had so much better pad thai at other thai restaurants. It had too much of sauce, no peanuts and no lemon was given.We had the fried pineapple and coconut icecream as dessert. The coconut icecream was good.Points of inprovement:Listen to what customers would like- veg or non vegWork on the quality of entrees|Stepping into the doorway, I felt like I was transported into another realm. The traditional interior design of this restaurant is simply astonishing. I was amazed looking at all the ornate details while walking to our table. When you enter, the hosts appear to tell you to take off your shoes and leave them in the front waiting areas. Then you are led to your table to sit down on comfy cushions with your legs hung below the table in an open space.Now, I must admit that I really wanted to love my experience due the unique ambiance and prior reviews. However, aspects were just amiss.Service was simply okay and servers were difficult to flag down. Portions were quite small for their price and the food was lackluster in comparison to other Thai places my friends and I have tried. For example, their pineapple fried rice had grains of rice that were....too grainy. Now that I think about it, I don't recall seeing much pineapple or at all in the dish. The meat present in our dishes were also very dry.Overall, it was a charming experience but changes can definitely be made for the food!|The pad see ew is pretty good but a little on the saltier side. You get a good amount for the price that you pay. Got take-out but will come back and try other meals!|Great experience!!! The food is delicious! We're definitely coming back. We were so happy to find this gem of a place. Also, my kid loved it here which is a plus! My husband got seconds just to hang out a bit longer and to try some of the other items from the menu.|Amazing ambiance! This Thai restaurant has solid food, but mostly it's a great experience.  There's lots of beautifully carved wood and the seats are at floor level which was fun.  But FYI, you need to take off your shoes so I would wear socks!!|Okay, so on ambiance alone, I'd rate Khan Toke 5 stars because I love taking off my shoes and sitting on the ground. Like the interior of this restaurant is so fun. If you want to feel like you're in someone's house rather than just another restaurant, definitely stop by here for that.Service is good, they're pretty quick and on top of it. The only thing is I think the thai food here is a, o-kay. Nothing blew my mind out of the four dishes we ordered, but nothing was terrible! We ordered 2 curry dishes and one noodle dish. Maybe curry just isn't their forte here, who knows.Food is typical SF Thai food prices, so all more than reasonable. If I had been blown away by the food, I'd definitely make this my new Thai spot. Instead, I will make this my new quirky Thai spot if I ever want to have a more intimate dinner setting where my friends are forced to take their shoes off.|Tom Yum soup here is DANK. They cook it for about 2-3 hours with all the spices and lemon grass, and all the good stuff. Me and my friend got the soup with prawns (says serves up to 4 but we finished the whole thing), pineapple fried rice with beef, and pad siew with pork. The food was all really good, the pad siew was slightly salty in my opinion but it was super flavorful and I ended up loving it. We also got the mango sticky rice, it was BOMB -- the rice is super warm and sweet. Prices are pretty reasonable for the kind of service/ambiance/food, imo. But it is a couple dollars more expensive than some cheaper thai restaurants in the city. This place would be a cute date spot! I love that you have to take off your shoes and you sit on the floor (but there's space for your legs beneath the table so your legs don't get all numb). Also service was pretty great, the lady that served us was super nice and attentive.|Last time I had take out was about 2 years ago. Couple days ago, I decided to have lunch with my bf. And only one person was working running 2 big party and 3 smaller ones. This review is solely on food. I got the Tom yum goong soup, this tasted just like tomato soup. It wasn't hot and sour whatsoever. Not even spicy... we also ordered the chicken curry lunch special and a beef pad Thai. The pad Thai was so sweet and the chicken curry was so plain. It was tasteless, flavor wasn't there. Tasted like water down curry. Not enough spices or herbs to any of the dishes. We won't be coming back. Even king's Thai on clement - a fast food restaurant taste 100% better than here.|No shoes allowed and tables that look like you're sitting on the floor, but in reality are basically sitting around a hole in the ground.  Kinda makes for an awkward arm to table alignment.  Reasonably priced dishes and pretty tasty though.Prawn in Blanket: Yeah, this is a gimmicky appetizer that's been appearing at Thai restaurants for a decade or two, but I still like it.  A wonton wrapper is tightly wrapped around a shrimp so it looks like a thing spring roll with a tail.  Lots of crunch with shrimp goodness inside.Duck Larb: Pretty heavy on the fish sauce and shallots, so probably too intense for a main dish but good for an appetizer.  The duck had a bit more personality than chicken.Lamb of Siam: There's a reason why this is in so many Yelp photos, because it is cool.  Two nicely marinaded lamb kabobs with a few peppers thrown in for good measure.  Great texture and such a nice flavor.Gaeng Kour Lamb: This lamb curry seemed a little disappointing compared to the Lamb of Siam kabob.  The lamb was limp and lacked any flavor, beyond the curry it was sitting in.  The baby eggplant was a bit too raw for my tastes.  The curry base itself had some nice flavors, but was a bit too mild on the pepper front.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thai Spice	""|I was having dinner at a girlfriend's house amd she decided on Thai. We had dinner on Thursday", August 23rd around 6:15pm. Not sure if she got takeout or delivery, but I believe it was delivery.*Angel Wings: Fried chicken wings with sweet garlic sauce and crispy basil ($11)*Tom Yum Chicken Soup: Spicy and sour soup with onions and mushrooms ($10)*Pad See You: Pan-fried flat rice noodles with broccoli, eggs, and garlic, Chicken ($12)*Crab Meat Fried Rice: Pan-fried rice with crab meat, egg, and onions ($14)*Eggplant: With Japanese eggplant and bean sauce, Served with Chicken $12)*String Bean Tofu: Sauteed crispy outer layer tofu with string beans and homemade spicy sauce, Hot and spicy, Vegetarian ($11)I didn't have anything to do with the ordering, but I believe we had the items above. (I found the prices online.) The crab fried rice had a good amount crab. And a nice salty savoriness to it. I'm a huge basil fan, so I was happy the wings and eggplant came with a good amount of basil. I'm big on veggies, so I enjoyed the string bean tofu. Plus, the green beans retained a nice crunch. I believe we ordered everything mild, so I added sambal to my plate to give the dishes some heat. I do love my spice.Great option for Thai delivery if you live in the Chinatown area.|I ordered delivery via DoorDash and I was pleasantly surprised by how good their pad see ew was. My sister and her boyfriend also liked theirs as well. They give you a lot of food, and the flavors are quite strong. I would daresay it was one of the better pad see ew dishes I've had, and I eat this dish a lot.Their chicken with string beans dish was okay, but their pad see ew was better!|It's been a really long time that I've been here and a couple of days ago I had a hankering for thai food so I decided to call Thai Spice to get some take out. Unfortunately, I either ordered the wrong dishes because the dishes I got were an expensive mistake!What I ordered:Red Curry with chicken ($13) - this dish was very rich with coconut milk and it had a strong flavor which I attributed to not just the curry but alot of salt (eeck!). The dish just had tons of bamboo strips and maybe a couple of pieces of basil. No other vegetable in this dish which made it very boring.Sauteed Mixed Vegetables with Polk ($12) - trying to be healthy? Well this dish had baby corn, cabbage, onions, zucchini, carrot bits, green beans, bean sprouts and small oblong strips of pork in a brown sauce. When I opened the take out container most of the veggies were really limp. Eating some of this dish, I thought it tasted somewhat odd 'cause it was super sweet like there was tons of sugar in that sauce making it inedible after a while.With these two entrees I got one order of jasmine rice ($2) and one order of brown rice ($2.75). Personally, I enjoyed the texture of the latter much more because it has some bite to it; whereas the jasmine rice is small grain and has a refined texture that really has a too soft mouth feel for me.Overall, I was highly disappointed by my entrees from Thai Spice. With a total cost of $33 for dinner and bad tasting food sadly I'm not likely to order from them again. :(|Really solid Thai food. Easily seated on a Sunday evening. Service is attentive and kind. Try the green basil curry with chicken and vegetables. The brown rice is particularly good. Not much spice in the dishes despite the name, but you can request heat. Eats aren't too expensive here; around $40 for 2 people. Ambiance is pleasant but not much to write about - spices line the red walls, tables are closely packed, not particularly modern or romantic. Gelato down the street :)|We wandered in here after doing the SCRAP Escape room a block away.I ordered the pad see ew with tofu and asked for thin noodles. The tofu was really good! I paid ~$16 after tax and tip. Service was fast, maybe because we were there a bit off-hours.My only complaint is that the restaurant was mostly empty, but they seated us right next to the door where we were blasted by the wind every time it opened.|We live next door and are regulars here- love it! Find it consistent and fairly authentic.|Stopped in and had pad Thai with chicken as a litmus test and I was pleasantly surprised.  I would come back here again.|This place was delicious!! The waiters were friendly and attentive, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the food was delicious and extremely well-priced. We ordered the money bags appetizer, a yellow chicken curry, and the string bean beef. Some of the best chicken I've ever had. Just found our new favorite Thai place.|I love ordering from here, excellent spring rolls. But they do not always include all the pieces of your takeout order...so check before delivery leaves! We were without rice for our curry last night :/|Thai spice babyyyy. Get ready for some pad Thai-licious. We ordered from Thai spice on door dash on a weeknight because sometimes a salad just doesn't cut it. I ordered the low carb pad Thai with shrimp, which I think the low carb is even better than the normal full carb version. Still super filling and tons of flavor. I wish it was spicier and had more peanuts on it (my two suggestions). We also ordered veggie egg roll bites and the spinach wraps. What looked Ah-mazing was the vegetarian giant spring rolls. Holy num, almost stole them from my manager! Would love to explore the menu further and try out some of the curry options as well.|Came here with a bunch of people and would say this place is good ambiencs wise. They have different spice jars hung on the wall which was pretty cool. Tried thai fried rice which was pretty good and upto my expectation.|Amazing Thai food every time I come here. Over the past few years ordered almost everything on the menu. I have yet to be disappointed. I would vote this best Thai food. Toto and dipping sauce amazing. Pad see ew always a most. Yesterday got the salt and pepper fish which turned out to be better than I thought. I take everyone that comes to visit here and they all agree it's the best. I|I'm positive that the owner is not Thai, since pretty much nothing here tastes like they're supposed to. The only thing they get right is the fried rice, but then how can you screw that up? I tried their stir-fried chicken with eggplant, which is one of my favorite Thai dishes, and it was incredibly bland and barely had any chicken in it. The ku chai was supposed to come with a sweet soy sauce with chili but it was actually--I'm not kidding--melted brown sugar. They're not even trying.|Great local spot. Pad thai is awesome though medium spice can range from not spicy to very spicy|Wandered into Thai Spice on Polk recently and was warmly received and offered any seat not taken. I ordered chicken satay and Thai spring rolls, both with peanut sauce.I was not disappointed. Satay was perfectly seasoned and grilled magnificently. The spring rolls were large enough to almost be a stand alone meal. The peanut sauce was so delicious, I wanted a bucket full. All the while, my water glass was repeatedly topped up- attentive and not in a helicopter way.I will return to try more menu items. I can't wait!|Good food but the service is unbelievably bad. Particularly from the woman behind the main cashier's desk. My sister ordered some lunch from there today and when she ordered it, we thought we would take it to go. As things turned out and we realized we had a little time to eat, we figured we could eat there. So we went back (we had only walked a block), and told the woman that we wanted to eat there. Not thinking it was a big deal," I couldn't fathom what the issue was so I gave her the benefit of the doubt and said """" we just ordered this food from your restaurant. We want to eat it here"""". Nope. Nope. You can't eat it here because you said it was to go. Wow!! Really!! I was shocked. We will never go back there and frankly", there are tons of places where the folks in charge actually know what customer service means. Not these guys. Spend your money somewhere else.|I was really excited to try this place out but disappointed once I did. We ordered the shrimp over the blanket and the shrimp was not cooked!!! Make sure to check the shrimp if you order it. The basil seafood is not so good, the scallops tasted very Oceana and the mussels were very dry. The chicken mango was good and so was the pork Thai fried rice (heavy)|Been going to this Thai spot for years now; not saying I dine here every day. The thing I can say about Thai Spice is that it is consistent. I haven't varied my meal choices but their fried rice, especially the Crab Fried Rice, has always been my go to (and yes I mostly do take out).The ambiance inside is quaint, good place to actually hear yourself speak.Just had another meal here today and I can safely say I will keep getting my Thai craving satisfied here.|This is my go-to Thai spot. The ambiance isn't anything special, but the food is . Fresh rolls are delicious. Curries, pad see ew, and basil leaf tofu are great too.|Good tom yum soup, but roti prata could use some work. The roti was more of a dense, greasy pancake than a flaky, thin crust. This made it very hard to eat," as it was very heavy.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Manora’s Thai Cuisine	|This place is great for lunch! The portions are huge and they are really fast. The only thing I'd add is when I ask for medium spice", it doesn't have spice at all. Otherwise, get the pad see ew! Delicious!|No idea how this place has 4-stars.I have been here 2x now for lunch and today was boring, bland and not worthwhile. Chicken was dry. Prawns tasted musty. No sauce. Asked for medium spice and there was no spice. There are far too many great places to eat in this city than to waste time and money on a place that just won't step up their game.|I came here for lunch with some coworkers because we wanted to try out their combination lunch specials. You can pick 2 entrees and it comes with Thai fried rice and lemon chicken soup. I ordered the garlic pork and the yellow chicken curry.The lemon chicken soup came out first and I was pleasantly surprised. Sometimes I get overwhelmed with citrus, but the soup was light and refreshing. It sort of reminded me of a Malaysian laksa soup, which I love! It also had a huge, tender chicken thigh in it. The combo plates came next, and at first they look like small portions, but since I got two protein dishes, I was pretty full afterwards. The garlic pork was a little salty, but still yummy with rice, and the yellow chicken curry was creamy and flavorful. The chicken was also super tender like in the soup (I suspect another thigh piece). I didn't even finish my rice. One thing I wish I could've changed is swapping the rice for salad or veggies of some sort. The combo plate was definitely protein heavy.Service was friendly and they fit 8 of us a table at lunch time, though we went a little early. Overall Manora's is a good choice for lunch in SoMa. Also btw, their yelp check-in deal of the $9.50 lunch special is no longer valid.|One of THE best Thai restaurants in the City! Everything tastes so fresh and authentic! The minced basil beef is a family favorite! So is the fried fish with garlic chili sauce! Unfortunately, they don't do the whole fish any longer, but the fillets are still tasty! The Thai iced tea is NOT to sweet, and everything else is just straight BOMB!!! You can tell a really good Thai place of off their Pad Thai! The noodles are perfectly soft, with a alight chew! There are so many places that have their noodles too hard, or too chewy! The flavor is awesome with the hint of dried shrimp! This place is a MUST have!|Constant good Thai food through  the years...|Always very consistent and delicious food.   One of the best Thai places around!   Thanks!|The place looks great. Felt like I was in Thailand. The decor was awesome. The food was ok. A little on the bland side. The chicken curry was tender but not dry and the curry was a little on the very mild side. The chicken satay sauce was awesome. The best they had was the little fried dumpling that tasted like samosas. The service was good but they didn't really recommended anything when asked. Overall good but not the best Thai food I ever had.|TLDR - Not the best Thai around, but lunch is reasonably pricedCame for lunch with a friend during the week and it wasn't too busy. They have a pretty good selection for their lunch combo specials for $10, and they also have rice plates and noodles for $9. I wasn't particularly impressed by their Thai food in comparison to other Thai places, but at least their lunch is affordable.* GAI YANG & SOM TUM ($9.75) - 3.5/5Papaya salad is one of my go-to's at Thai restaurants. Theirs wasn't bad but definitely on the sweet side, catering to American tastes, and didn't have any salty, acidic and spicy components. The grilled chicken was okay, not particularly special or memorable.|I tried to use my check in special for the 2 entree with soup and rice for $9.50 but the guy said they didn't accept it and that it something that only yelp controls but I knew he didn't know what he was talking about. It's only 3 bucks but still if you're gonna have a check in promo, try to honor it and not give me some bs about it's not the right restaurant. Not even sure how the food is but service sucks! Not even sure how to contact yelp or whatever he was tryin to say to weasel out of that situation. Was willing to try another time but this just changed my mind|We ordered a couple of weeks ago. The food smelled stale, so much so, the one could not consume it. We ordered the pretty standard dishes/minced chicken, flat noodles and shrimp.Would definitely not order again.|Always a good meal Pad se ew is fire|Was in San Francisco craving Thai food and decided to try this restaurant out. When I walked in, my party and I were greeted and sat down within a second! The people that work there are very friendly and welcoming. The ambiance of the place is so beautiful with art pieces all around. It seemed like a very authentic Thai restaurant. I loved how they had candles and flowers on every table.The food here is very good and it came out so fast! I got the Pad Thai, basil beef with spicy chili sauce (#33) jasmine rice and a Thai Tea! The food is very flavorful! The beef was the perfect amount of spiciness for me and it was so unbelievably tender! Other places that I've been to have very tough beef which makes it very unenjoyable to eat. As for the Pad Thai, it had a nice kick to it, served with lime and we added chicken to it which made it that much more tasty.|Very good Thai food. The #8 appetizer is delicious! Also the basil chicken is amazing. Husband got the Curry. It could have been spicier, but I love spicy food. He liked it the way it was.|Disappointing even for a city with mostly average Thai food. Inexpensive, pre-cooked lunch combos are not worth the parking hassles.|The food is ok.  The service is non-existent.  However what bothers me the most is that the deal advertises on yelp is no longer valid.  The business needs to either update their offers on yelp or honor what is advertised.|This was the first thai place I tried when I was younger, my mom introduced me to this place. Luckily I got a job very close by and I am able to order from here online and walk a few blocks to pick it up. Not only is the food amazing but the ambiance is so serene. I absolutely love the lemongrass coconut soup that they serve with their lunch specials, which by the way are very reasonably priced. For the same price that I would pay for a deli sandwich and a soft drink in this area you get a lot more food here. My favorite is the panang-nur and the nur-pad-prik, not to mention all the sides it comes with. The food here is too die for, now I just wish I lived closer so I could order on the weekends.|Usually, I don't write Yelp reviews for restaurants that I visit, but I felt the urge to do that in this particular case because the food was dreadful. I ordered duck curry, and it contained so much grease/oil wasn't able to force myself to finish it. That small part of the dish that I ate caused some pain in my stomach, and I hope that I didn't get food poisoning (will update this review, if I did).Regret that I came here and paid the money. I highly recommend against dining at this place.|Good PadThai = Doesnt taste like ketchup, cocktail sauce or sickenly sweet.... noodles - Non-mushy or decimated bits.  *sigh*  the search continues.C -- PadThai: More on the sweeter side and a bit cocktail saucey.  But only midly so.  Portions are large for this area and good for carry out.  Would I go again?  Hrm, it's a block away from my apt.....  probably.  To the Bozos who were complaing about the decor.  Probably shouldn't copy and paste the same wording as your pal.  And what were you expecting??  It's not meant to be trendy.  Think hole in the wall, only the hole is a little bigger and the wall is a little nicer than most....P.S. They do NOT honor the yelp offer|This is one of the best Thai Restaurants in the US! And my go to in san Francisco...I have been coming here 29 years and it's always perfect. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu, especially the Curries.|This place is not real thai food.

"Thai House Express	""|This is my go-to place when I am at home and I want good Thai food delivered. This is a no-frills neighborhood restaurant with very good Thai food. Nothing fancy", but very good quality.|First time ordering delivery from here. I've never been to thier restaurant so this review is just for the food delivered. Lets start with the plus. Their curry both the yellow chicken and pumpkin curries are good. The seafood pad kee Mao is pretty good too. All their dishes are a very good generous amount. Some places only give you 30% less than what you see in the picture. Plus their delivery came on time. Now for the negatives. The pad see ew was very disssapointing. First I ordered beef but got chicken which isn't a big deal. The problem was the flavor. It was so bland. Ive never had pad see ew that bland before. I had the noodles broken but at lease the taste was there. Previous review had also commented on the same issue but I like to taste it myself before judging. They definitely need to enhance the flavor more. The pad thai and papaya salad was ok nothing wow. Definitely had better. Overall my experience was ok. Would I order again? Sure! I mean their curries are good and the seafood noodle plus for the amount you pay, they do give a good amount of food.|Love the food. Everything is just delicious. Rotten waiters. We asked for jalapeños twice and they scolded us. The nerve, avoid this place and go get some pizza. I'll post pictures anyways since the papaya salad was amazing.Did I mention nasty waiters?|Whenever a restaurant has Khao Soi on the menu, I order it. It's a curry based soup dish from Northern Thailand and after spending some time there - I fell in love and miss eating it terribly. Most restaurants don't even come close but man, Thai House Express does. I have also eaten their Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, Pork Belly, Baked Tofu appetizer and their delicious Lychee Sangria! Everyone should definitely try the sangria! All the food was tasty. And they mean what they say when you ask for spicy - you better be able to handle the heat. Otherwise, I highly recommend ordering it without spice.Extremely pleased with their food, service, and location.|This place, a block away from one of the busiest intersections in the Castro, is a perfect spot for Thai food. Friendly service, quiet atmosphere, and delicious food. I've been here about 6 times, and every time I'm impressed that the food is delicious. The portions are just right: not too much, not too little. I really enjoy their pra ram (the peanut sauce, the vegetables), and noodle dishes. The curries are also a favorite of mine to order. This is a great neighborhood spot. Perfect place to bring a date, or people watch.|The design inside is different from the other Thai restaurants. Really simple and comfortable.The fired rice was really good! The fired dumplings? were just okay. The chicken wings were good! But my friend and I didn't like the red curry very much because we usually don't like one of them inside. The four stars are for the fired rice.|I'm so sad. I was so excited for this Pad see ew I just ordered from door dash. The noodles are all broken in pieces, feels like jelly just falling apart and it taste really sweet and has a weird after taste. Pad see ew is usually savory a little sweet with lost of flavor.  It definitely taste like fast food pad se ew. Taste really fake! King of Thai and Marnee Thai are way better and they're  the same price as this place. I feel played and not satisfied at all!|Order the Khao Soi. Tastes just like it came from Chiang Mai. Plus, it's massive and cheap. The papaya salad was crunchy and refreshing, without an overpowering taste of fish sauce that papaya salad sometimes suffers from.I'll definitely be back.|These negative reviews are silly -- maybe don't order Thai if you don't like spicy food...Fast, friendly, pretty authentic, cheap," tasty and large portions.|Great service and food ALWAYS delivers. This is my go-to comfort Thai. Delicious! Definitely recommend.|Solid place for a weekday dinner or some takeout. Food is always delicious and the service is good. Only reason it's not 5-star for is that I find that even the """"spicy"""" curry's and dishes aren't spicy enough for me! Given I can handle a bit of heat", it is probably more than enough for most people!|3.75 round up Thai actually isn't my favorite Asian cuisine (put a Vietnamese menu in my hands & I'm a happy diner), but for us, Thai is easy & familiar & we agree on same three or four dishes. Thai House Express is located at the end of the last commercial block on Castro before it turns into a long stretch of mostly residences. I like the vibe here, it's comfortable, the wait staff is kind & jovial, but leave you to your food after you've ordered. Pad Thai, Krung Pao Beef, & Yellow Curry Chicken are our go-tos & the versions served here, though not exceptional, are solid enough to be on our rotation. I'll order Jasmine rice instead of sticky rice next time; my rice was so hard 15 minutes into dinner that it was impossible to eat even when moistened with curry or Krung Pao sauce. Do get the sweet & delicious Mint Lemonade. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced; most items are under $14.|Their staff has been very unprofessional and rude.I sit there for my pick up and I saw my food has been packed and sat on their front counter for 10 minutes and I finally approached them and asked that is it my food and this guy confirmed my name and gave it to me.And instead of being nice he was being very rude.Would never go back again.|I decided to try out their Pad Kee-Mao. It took over an hour for the food to be delivered even though I'm a 5-10 minute drive away.When the food arrived, all of the noodles were stuck together in a giant mush. The food was greasy and not very flavorful. I'm usually a huge fan of this dish but I was very unimpressed with what I received.|While visiting San Francisco's I was referred to Thai house express. Don't let the name fool you, when I think of anything express I think of fast food, or something you would find in a mall. This restaurant is a sit down restaurant located on 19th and Castro. It s in a blue building on the corner. This wasn't he best Thai food I h e ever had, but it was decent. We paid $12 for the lunch special Witt came with a variety of options including a salad, soup and appetizer. You do get a good little bit of food for the price you pay. The restaurants as clean and there was ample seating.|This is one of my favorite spots to get delivery from. I love their pad see-ew it is so flavorful and delicious that I really have not tried much else except for their curry which is also very tasty.|The worst Tom Yum I've ever tried. It was fishy spicy oil soup. The rest of my order was alright, though I've tried better.|Ordered delivery through Yelp and the food came hot and on time.  I ordered the dungeness crab pad thai,  Minced chicken basil and fried chicken wings.  Everything was good.  The Pad Thai was okay, I've had better.  Over all the food was good but not great.  I don't know if I'd order from here again.|The first time I have dinner here and I get a mild food poisoning.  I say mild because I did not actually go all out (you know what I mean) did get cramps and felt bloated for hours though.  See they recently had violations for food temp and mild rodent infestation.  Giving them an extra star for improved health score.  I had a vegetarian only dinner.|I wanted to like this place more but it just wasn't all that great. I love pad thai and order it pretty frequently and i gotta say, this was just not very good pad thai. it definitely was not bad (I've also had bad pad thai), just not the best. They used angel hair pasta which was confusing to me...this made the dish kind of mushy and not very pad thai-like. My friend and I also ordered the Panang curry, which was really good actually," as was the jasmine rice. Just an OK meal. Not rushing back here anytime soon.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Old Siam Thai Restaurant	""|I've walked into this restaurant a few times over the years as it is in the theater district of San Francisco's Union Square and it offers a very excellent menu tasty food and dishes at decent prices for that part of town I enjoyed the fried rice with chicken and in the past have had some of the other Vietnamese dishes that are all excellent staff is friendly parking is not easy it is in downtown area so it's only garages maybe some street parking and of course public transportation is the easiest way to use this restaurant as it is just one block from Powell Street BART station I highly recommend this restaurant|Food is good. Service is good. Lots of customers. My husband and I were going to Kin Khao but it's an hour wait and the bar was on waiting list as well. They don't do take out either. So went walked across the street and there The Old Siam. We chucked down four dishes and some beer. We had Pad Thai", Lemongrass chicken, fish cake, and chicken satay. All very good. We went back today and had siam wings, special thai noodles, and pineapple fried rice. All very good as well. Totally recommend!|The thai tea is very sweet but delicious!I ordered chicken pad thai and it was really good, I enjoyed it a lot. I wish it had more peanuts in it though! No wait, very clean, LOVE the pricing more than anything. Pad thai was $12 which is fair for downtown SF! And the thai tea was $3 and change. My whole meal was $16.  :) would come back again!|We were craving Thai and we just got done shopping so we relied on the friendly Yelp to help us feed our cravings. We stumbled upon The Old Siam and were kind of skeptical because of the reviews but the menu items looked pretty good, so we gave it a whirl.When we arrived there was a 10-15 minute wait for 2 and the wait time went by fairly quick. The restaurant looks bigger than it is but still pretty small. It's right across the street from Park 55.Service was decent. The water is is served without ice so if you want ice you need to request for ice with your water. The food was mediocre. I ordered the beef pad se-ew and it tasted bland. I had to add A LOT of red sauce because I like my food spicy but I can't fault them for that. All in all mediocre Thai and cheap too!|Really solid Thai food. It was not as busy as I thought for a work week lunch rush. Food came out quick, tasted delicious, and good service. What more can you ask?Pineapple Fried Rice did not have a lot of pineapples," which I liked. They did not skimp out on the chicken either. I definitely would recommend it.|Don't let the """"3.5 star"""" fool you ", this place is amazing , the food was perfect, the service was great . I ate here twice , the weekend I was there , but didn't get any pictures because I devoured the food LOL|My friends and I were craving Thai food at the time (well more like I was) and this restaurant happened to be in the area so we decided to stop n and try it.I ended up getting the Pad Kee Mao here and it wasn't all that good. It lacked the nice rich flavor that a Pad Kee Mao has, and ended up coming off a little boring. The noodles were cooked okay, they were well cooked in some parts but had gotten a little broken in others. The overall seasoning and toppings though were my main gripe with this dish.I also tried my friends Pad Thai and it ended up tasting really sweet and quite lacking in depth.Overall a pass, I feel there are better choices in San Francisco.|This is one of my go-to's when I want a hot lunch. Service is prompt and courteous when I go there. I'm a regular here with my fellow coworker and we've noticed this one woman who works here and we don't know why. She obviously hates working here and her face shows it every time we see her. We've come up with some possible reasons: she's the owner's daughter, she doesn't want to look for another job, she's just a miserable, unhappy person. Some of my favorites are their combination plates that are available from 11:00-5:00 for $11.95 (+ $2.99 if you include soup to your lunch) and the duck fried rice which is pretty generous with duck. When I've ordered the combination lunch, I've gotten the fried egg rolls, fried tofu, chicken satay, barbecued chicken, chicken krapaw, curry chicken, all delicious, never disappointed.* Today I was served water, which I drank from, in a filthy glass. I didn't realize how filthy it was until I lowered the water level by drinking from it. It had an oily film on the inside, obviously not washed. I'm having some reservations about eating here from now on. I didn't even get an apology. I should've walked out.|Came here for a late lunch with two people who had never had Thai food before. They left not hating Thai food, so that must mean something! This is definitely a solid Thai restaurant with a good amount of options. The servers were also nice and answered any questions I had. I enjoyed their lunch combo and appreciated all the different options that were available. Thought it was choose fried rice or pad thai, but it comes with both! That was pretty cool. My favorite was probably their Tom Kha soup. It was a good blend of tangy and coconut flavors. Between the two desserts, mango with sticky rice was definitely the winner. The mango was AMAZINGLY ripe and would melt in your mouth right away. Combined with the sticky rice, it was unbeatable.|Worst experience seriously. I have never had this kind of bullshit receipt before. Their service wasn't good also foods were bad but they forced a 18% of gratuity on us. Okay, so far, I can try to understand it. BUT, the most ridiculous thing was they actually calculate a tax includes a tip into total amount of items. Why should I pay a tax of tip???? I know there's only $1 of difference, but I don't want to pay a tax of tip. And we complained about that, but all the servers pretended like they don't understand!!! I felt like they are thinking we complain about this to avoid tipping. Anyway, it was so bad. Terrible experience. We just waste our $66. Also, they will ask you additional tip on a final receipt. Be careful.|The FoodI ordered the Thai Tradition Noodle Soup, there's nothing wrong with the noodles, the meat and the vegetables it was just the broth that tasted a bit weird. It kinda smells in a bad way but I'm​ guessing ​that it is the traditional taste or smell of their noodle broth. The PlaceThe place is medium. I went there on weekends and I waited for 15 minutes for a tableThe ServiceThe staffs were okay.OverallNot sure if I would come back here but If I was really hungry and this is the closest restaurant, wouldn't​ hurt to try their other menu.|I was craving for Thai food and this was very close to our hotel. Restaurant was busy when we arrived but wait wasn't that long. Everything we ordered was just okay, nothing stood out.|A SOLID choice for Thai food. This place has never failed me - and I don't expect it to.Excellent portioning and quick service.Great for groups and last minute decision making while trying to find a place in the City!Still close to Union Square and Bart.Pretty convenient location.|Came here for lunch. Decided not to order off the lunch special seeing I wanted to know if this place had better Larb & Tom Kha Gai. Tom Kha Gai which is Sliced chicken in coconut soup with galangal, lemongrass, mushroom and onions, was definitely on point. I was able to get a half order so I could enjoy other things. I really enjoy this soup. It is one of my favorite Thai foods.The Larb which is a choice of ground pork, beef or chicken tossed with red onion, green onion, cilantro and special lime sauce. I chose the pork. I was ok, not the best I've had, not the worst. Seams to lack some flavor. The Thai coffee on the other hand was spot on. Full of flavor and just the right amount of caffeine kick. Would definitely go back for one. Service was good and very friendly. No wait to be seated and food came out fast.|Chicken pad Thai was decent. A little bit on the sweet side.  But the portion was good for lunch.  The menu appeared to be focused which is great.  I prefer restaurants to have a focus on dishes their great at rather then have over 100s of items they rarely cook.  The service was great. My water was refilled frequently without me asking.|Place - It is easy to find. There are lots of tables inside. Good for large group. Clean interior. Taste - I ordered a wanton soup and lunch menu. * Wanton soup - I thought it is wantin noddle soup but it was just wanton soup. There were avfew wantons, a few vegies and few meat. The amount was too small. My boyfriend ordered it and ate all for few minutes. If u want a meal, it will be better to order wanton noddle soup. Taste was soso. Nothing special. The quality of wanton and soup was not really good. * Lunch combo -Lunch combo was btw 11am to 5pm. I could choose one appiti and meat. It came with egg fried rice and noddle. I picked chicken satay and pad kraw(beef). The dish was good! Especially, chicken satay was greally good. Others were also good but overall little salty.Service and Price - Service was good but little slow. Price was reasonable.|Went here for lunch, but had to get our orders to go because of the line. Great price point and good, flavorful pad see ew that wasn't too greasy. Also very clean and chic on the inside (very unexpected considering the exterior!).|This restaurant was awwwwesome I visited San Francisco with my son and Friend, and we were only there for three days and ate here twice. The hotel we stayed at recommended it to us and it will not disappoint.|Terrible food and terrible service. I love Thai food but this was inedible. The workers were rude and not understanding when we were disappointed with the food they presented to us. If I could I would give this place zero stars. Go get grab a street hot dog and you will be way more pleased than going to this place. The worst part of this place however was definitely the service, at least if you're going to serve nasty food get or train your workers to not be rude to your costumers!!|We meant to eat across the street at Kin Khao, but the wait was for an hour for a party of 2. Starved and craving Thai, it just so happened The Old Siam Thai Restaurant was conveniently across the street. Actually most of the diners who could't get into KK, went to Old Siam too. The restaurant was busy during our visit and was constant. Not a huge place, but comfortable for small to large parties. We sat a 2 seater that faces the street - great for people watching. We ordered Tom Kha ($9) for an appetizer soup. Enough to serve 4 people in small bowls and we had 2 bowls each. We ordered the soup with chicken and there were a lot of chicken pieces in it. I really enjoyed the soup and the flavor. Needed more chili flakes, however. The extra spices were on the table to easy to add.For my entree I ordered the Pad See Ew ($10) with Pork and my friend ordered the Pork Belly Chef Speciality with a side of white rice.My noodles lacked oyster sauce and was bland unfortunately. I hadn't had Thai in a while and I was really looking forward to some delicious Pad See Ew. I was disappointed. The Pork Belly was way too salty for my taste and they were big chunks of what I thought looked liked bacon.  There were a lot of veggies and my friend really thought the pork belly would be on top and not mixed in. It would have been better to just placed the pork belly separate and on its own and customers can mix it themselves.Service was good and our waters were refilled constantly. It was a quick meal, and glad we had no wait. We probably spent half the price then what we would have spent across the street. The location is borderline sketchy / tenderloin," so I recommend not sticking around too late in the area.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lemon Grass Thai Cuisine	|Great Thai food for takeout. They cover all the basics with no frills. Fast and tasteful. I regularly have the green curry with chicken. Environment is intimate but I rarely eat at the restaurant.|I've had thai style crab fried rice (kao pad boo) hundreds of times in Thailand and here. It's my comfort food. This is the worst I've ever had! If it was only unauthentic bland and americanized I could live with it", I'm used to that. This place adds something that tastes like wasabi, and very well could be, that overwhelms and has no business in the dish. If they can screw up a basic and simple thai dish so thoroughly I have no faith in their ability to make anything else.|When you step into Lemon Grass, it looks more upscale than your usual Thai restaurant but you're still going to get that predictable quality of food you'd expect from any other hole-in-the-wall.The price is respectable for a majority of the dishes with a few outliers on their menu that warrants a higher cost and the reason why this place is two dollar signs on Yelp. The service is quick and you get generous portions of whatever it is you order that I guarantee will fill you up. As for quality, it's not gourmet by any means but it isn't too pedestrian either. With five friends dining here, after sampling everything family style, I'd strongly recommend the green curry with chicken if you end up here. Rice isn't included in the entree so you'll have to order a bowl on your own.|Came here after advice from an uber driver (might have been my first mistake) that raved about Lemon Grass being his favorite thai place in the city. One night babysitting, I ordered Beef pad see ew and the fried calamari. Fried calamari - 1/5.... definitely not squid. disappointing to say the least, frozen, rubbery, gross. Do not order! Unless you enjoy faux calamari. Beef pad see ew - 3/5... average takeout thai I doubt I'll ever eat here again, it's okay takeout, but there are definitely better options out there!|Wow!  I've eaten at dozens of Thai restaurants from NYC to Europe and this was the cream of the crop!  The atmosphere is nice and relaxing and the food is just AMAZING and authentic.  We will go here every time we visit San Fran!|Lemon Grass has always been at the top of my list for Thai but recently I was using the app Eat24 slid to grub hub by Yelp and saw that LG raised their delivery limit to $25 and added a $3.00 delivery charge. To me that enough that I'm paying the higher item prices for the delivery convenience but require the delivery and minimum total of $25 when it used to be $15 is too much so I personally will not be ordering from Lemon Grass Thai no longer.|Stopped by on a whim... great little place! Excellent service! The pineapple fried rice was a great dish. Also had the chicken Satay and Meng Sum!!!|I'd rate the food a 4- or 5-star.  But if not the worst service I've ever in my life experienced it ranks the next one to the worst. To be fair, they were probably down a server tonight -  I am pretty sure it was a bus-person that took our order and bussed the tables.They seem far more focused on their take-out business than on their in-house clientele.  In fact, the food is good enough that we may never set foot in the restaurant again - but may order delivery.Service was slow.  We got the initial drinks we ordered but not the second order (but weren't charged - so they got that right).  After the appetizers there were couples that were seated, ate their meal, paid and left before someone came and asked if we were ready for our main course!  When we were done, with all the obvious signs of being done - napkins off our laps and on the table, silver ware appropriately off the table and on the plates, plates moved aside etc.  it was impossible to get anyone to come give our check.  Even the clue of a credit card on the table was to no avail.Eventually, I gave up and went up to the lady at the cash register (who was attending to many screens from companies like GrubHub) to pay and get our leftovers packaged.  And *still* it took a long time to finish checking out.  They insisted on packaging our leftovers - even though I would have been glad to do so.  After I'd paid and waited ten minutes or so, I was about to walk out of the restaurant without our leftovers when they finally were handed to us.Summary:  Great food.  At least tonight - worst service ever.  Maybe they should become a deliver-only restaurant :-)|Best priced restaurant in the neighborhood! The portions are copious-- not the most amazing tasting pad see ew but everything else I've had was delicious. I recommend trying the spicy chicken soup or one of the curries!|Really great for a quick and inexpensive dinner. Will warn you that the food isn't really that authentic and it's not super tasty, but it is a great spot to get fed a ton of food for under $15.All of the mains on their menu (everything from curries to stir fries to noodle dishes etc) is around $12, with a lot clocking in at $10. Their appetizers range from a few dollars to $14 for a sample platter, and their soups are $6-$7.With prices like this you'd imagine that the portions would be stingy, but our table really over ordered this philosophy. I opted for a papaya salad and a bowl of Tom Yum soup and had to leave half the salad on the table- others in the group tried the hot beef salad and shrimp pad thai. Everything could have used a bit more spice and flavor in general, but again, good value for what you're paying for.|The spicy green curry is INCREDIBLE. I don't even order rice with it because it's so good. The coconut chicken soup is also great. I was feeling sick and had a spicy Thai craving, and it was exactly what I needed. I came back to try the Pad Thai and it also hit the spot. The staff is also super nice and accommodating - definitely will be back.|Stumbled upon this Thai restaurant and it was a great find! Thom Kha soup was great (not spicy at all which I missed a little but the flavor was delish) chicken fried rice was yummy, veggie rolls so good. Definitely will be coming back!|Great take out food. Travels well, tastes delicious, very fresh, and super quick service. The portions are really big too. Not too expensive and their delivery is really efficient. The restaurant is nice as well.|We've ordered takeout at work from Lemongrass and have been pretty satisfied with the food and speedy delivery. The pad thai is always a familiar and popular crowd-pleaser. I appreciate that it's not overly sweet like other places. I like the red curry duck. The duck imparts a gamier flavor to the curry and they do a good job of not overcooking the duck to where it is really tough. Nice rich and fatty flavor. The chicken yellow curry is a nice choice if you're looking for a less spicy curry. Nice variety of stir fry dishes too especially seafood and veggies. Order the appetizer combo to start if you want a little of everything. I like the fried veggie spring rolls for textural contrast. Also make sure to add on a side of the bright cucumber salad to break up all the wonderful curries. Lemongrass Thai Cuisine is a safe choice for a group but also has a few surprises in the menu to keep things fresh.|I love the coconut soup for this place. I ordered off of Yelp and though it took a long time to get delivered to my place of work, it was worth the wait. The soup isn't very big (small in fact) but it is so hearty and filling that I didn't feel hungry afterward. The price is what's to be expected in SF. The chicken satay is good too, if soup isn't your thing.|Great atmosphere. Good spicy Thai food. What more can you ask for? Recommend the Tom Kha Gai soup!|Ketchup based Pad Thai aka Western Thai food. If you are looking for authentic Thai cuisine, this is not your place.|For someone who is really picky about Thai food, this place is pretty solid. Some menu items aren't the best I've had- the Tom Ka is lacking. But for the most part it's a really consistent restaurant with kind waitresses and quick service. Definitely a favorite of mine!|I have been exploring what is on Polk St. since I work on Van Ness and checking out all that Polk has to offer. I stopped by this place, there weren't a lot of people but nice ambiance. The service was great. I ordered their special soft shell crab and it was delicious. I had a very relaxing meal and will go back if I am in that area again.|This place is the absolute worst. The last time I ordered from them I ordered at 6:30pm and the food arrived at 8:35pm. I called about six times to check on it and they kept saying it was coming. No apologies, no offer to refund. When I asked for a refund they didn't understand what I was saying and hung up the phone. This is the second time they've been more then 30 minutes late with a scheduled delivery. DON'T ORDER DELIVERY FROM HERE!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Basil Canteen	|2 Bacardi Mojitos Thai iced teaGlow grab GAi gra praoIndian bread steak and curry saAuce. (Made the old way)coconut rice Popcorn chickenDrunken beef|Came here for a birthday celebration on a Friday night. Seating was easy and they were not very crowded. They have a large space with an upstairs and a downstairs", which was nice, and plenty of wooden tables.We started with a round of appetizers (all priced ~$8.50): the crispy pork wontons were my favorite, and tasted better than most restaurant gyoza appetizers. The popcorn chicken was good as well - very crispy and fried. The taro chips I thought were too thick and chewy.My partner and I shared the pad thai ($13) and the Chinese broccoli with wok-fried crispy pork belly ($14). Both were delicious. The pad thai in particular was one of the better ones that I have had - just the right amount of sweet and savory. The pork belly was good as well, slightly spicy and garlicky, but the ratio of veggies to meat could have been better.For dessert we had the fried banana with coconut ice cream (delicious) and the mango with sticky rice (equally delicious) (both $7.50). The staff were kind enough to light candles in the desserts and sing happy birthday.Overall a little pricey for Thai food but given that it's SF, to be expected. The food was very good.|Pretty standard Thai food. It was good. I have been to a lot of Thai places in the Bay Area and the taste here was not a lot different. Service is good and drinks are quite good.Thai iced tea with coconut milk wasn't that great.Street parking as expected.|I am so pleased with my experience here.  We were seated immediately, the servers were attentive and polite, and the quantity and quality of the food was excellent.  I have zero complaints.  Well done!|Awesome place for happy hour with great thai appetizers! We ordered the chicken skewers, taro fries, and tapioca balls. All of them were were good especially the tapioca ball. The wrap had a good chewy texture and the filling was a little on the sweet side with peanuts, with no meat. Drinks specials were decent, they have a good variety of cocktails for $7 each and Thai draft beer for $4 each. Would definitely come back to this place for the tapioca balls!|I came here after hip hop dance class. Came in at 7:45 on a Thursday and it was pretty empty. They gave complimentary salted peanuts at the beginning, which were pretty nice. I ordered lemon grass chicken with brown rice. It was okay at best - slightly overcooked and too salty. I did not finish it. Bill was $20 after a 20% tip. Probably won't return here.|Made reservations here for dinner on a random Friday night. The three of us were seated upstairs. Ambiance was nice, & service was good.Would recommend:- Tapioca Pork Dumplings: tapioca had a great texture, chewy & soft! I thought it worked very well as a lettuce wrap. Reminds me of Vietnamese Banh Bot Lot. Only complaint is it's a little heavy on the peanuts. Other than that, would order again.- Lychee with unfiltered sake cocktail: I love unfiltered sake! This drink was strong with good lychee flavor. Ordered two of these!- Beef Roti: never had roti like this, was pretty decent, & all the ingredients worked well together. Enjoyed the crunchiness of the roti.Would skip:- Khao Soi: way too heavy in my opinion, which khao soi typically is because of the curry-based broth. This one had egg noodles & pickled veggies which just didn't work for me.Spring rolls, popcorn chicken, pad kee mao, & other dishes we ordered weren't super memorable. Probably wouldn't think of this place the next time I want Thai food. It is a good place for after-work/happy hour drinks! Plus that they take reservations!|I went here last night with a friend to grab dinner. We ordered:Eggplant curry: This was okay. I wish they had used more sauce on the vegetablesPumpkin curry with shrimp:Really good! The curry sauce was super well done. It was a good combination of sweet and spicy. Corn fritters(appetizer):So good! So of the biggest corn fritters I have ever seen. And the sweet cucumber sauce was a great pairing. I would definitely order this again.|I've been back to this location a second time and still, I just hate the atmosphere here. It's also expensive for what you receive and the space isn't great for conversation as everything carries.Basil Canteen is one of those in Nouveau restaurants that pop up in Soma and are gone within a year or two. The spaces try for super posh and end up looking very much like a wine bar that services food. *Cough* Everything on Folsom *Cough*My first trip in I got the Tom Ka soup which made me slightly sick. My second trip I went for the Pad Thai, and again, wasn't blown away by the food. Though both times the service was friendly and warm.It's an easy spot to drop by, but I dearly miss my Triptych.|The spicy rejoice!   Came here with my BFF Kevin before a hilarious show at SF Oasis right across the street.  Had the delicious larb salad to share but my review is for the spicy pad thai. Thoroughly enjoyed the level of spiciness because I adore spicy.   The atmosphere and service also impeccable.  Wonderful dining experience.|Had great food here before but had a pumpkin curry takeout tonight that was watered down and totally bland. It was served in a short and wide takeaway container instead of the normal containers used for soups or curry which was also kind of annoying. I wouldn't go out of the way to order from here again.|Love this place! Great Thai food and lots of vegetarian options. One of my favorite lunch spots in SF.|I have come here so many times - great cocktails, good vegetarian options and good service. Can't ask for more. It's more upscale than a lot of Thai places. It's good for a large group as well since it accepts reservations - celebrated a friend's birthday as well. One of my usual Thai spots in the city.|Went here after a long weekend of spectator sports, we were hungry and craving delicious Thai food.  It had been on my bookmark for a while, and I was delighted to finally get to try it.  What a treat!  Food was delicious, and the seasoning was balanced.  The restaurant is set in a great space - sort of bar and industrial, but cozy and inviting all the same.  Service was great - there were 7 of us, with 20 mins notice, but they were ever so accommodating.   We ordered:1) garlic & pepper shrimp.  tasty, but not quite what I expected.  Shrimp was fresh and cooked well. 2) drunken beef. yummy3) gai gra prao - yummy4) pad ke mao - one of the better ones we've had.  made perfectly.5) choo chee salmon - great red curry sauce - perfect for all the rice we ordred6) jasmine and coconut rice.  great combinations7) crab fried rice (gluten free)... we needed to accommodate a gluten allerty - and they have a separate one for that, which is great.Also - they have some fun cocktails and mocktails too - which is always a nice touch. the BEST part (for me at least) was the black sticky rice, coconut cream and mango dessert.  I'm not a dessert person, but this is one of my all time favourites and, it was great.  I loved the addition of the puffed/crispy rice.Anyway - yummy, great space and a pretty affordable prices... win win.  :)|Cheapish, speedy and gets the job done. I live pretty close so I'll be back if I'm wanting Thai food without walking down the street further to Basil.The happy hour specials are quite good deals but otherwise the bar program should just be skipped.|Basil Canteen has to be one of my favorite Thai places in the Bay and not just because I live one block from here. The menu is super unique while still holding on to traditional Thai flavors. Suffice it to say it's where I take friends who come through to my hood. I'll usually order us:1) taro fries - if you like taro you'll love it in fries form.2) chive cakes - who knew that chives could be made into little cakes?! Seasoned so well with a slight kick, these cakes are deep fried green heaven.3) Choo Chee Salmon - this is a pan-fried salmon steak that is without fail perfectly crisp on the outside and buttery tender on the inside - the way salmon should be cooked. Comes with cauliflower (vegetable of the year 2017) in Thai red curry.The restaurant setup itself is super nice - two levels with an intimate upstairs seating area, and a communal table downstairs. Plus really warm service. Can't go wrong :)|I would say a solid 3.5 stars. I thought the vibe and atmosphere of the restaurant was amazing and food was decent. Service was also good. I was disappointed that my jasmine rice was burnt. I asked for a new one and it was also burnt... so that ruined my meal a bit. Green curry and drunken beef was amazing. Roti starter was really sweet and I would advise against. Mango and sticky rice was good.|Decent happy hour food specials. Thai beer was $4 each, cocktail was $7 I believe, with a bunch of appetizers to choose from. We picked the chicken satay skewers, taro fries, tapioca dumplings. The food came in about 15 minutes after our order was taken. OMG everything smelt really good! Honestly I think everything was pretty good here, the taro fries batter was good, chicken skewers was grilled to perfection with a smell of charcoal or grill (in a good way), and the tapioca ball was really interesting, the outside was chewy like mochi and the inside was a little on the sweet side but it wasn't a dessert. It was just a light afternoon snack and with 2 drinks and 3 appetizers shared between two of us, the bill came out to be $31 so it was less than $40 with tax and tip. Not bad at all. Service was great and they also take reservation.|Food: amazing! Very very good good. We went with a group of 5 so we just ordered a bunch of different shared plates. Everything was delicious. Drinks: drinks were ok. Seemed a little weak so some people just switched to wine. Service: not great. We were there for almost 2.5 hours because the service was so slow. We had to repeatedly ask and follow up on our requests. The staff were all super nice and pleasant, but just sooo slow. That's why they only get 4 stars. I would try this place again to give them another shot at service. Maybe it was just an off night.|3.5 stars but rounded up because the food was good and the space was nice.I ordered the pad see ew and my brother got the dish with char sui pork and deep fried pork. We were kinda surprised that his dish was all meat and a scoop of rice with no vegetables. Everything on his plate was tasty but he didn't use the sauce provided (it was heavily sour).Nothing went wrong, but nothing was outstanding which leads to 3.5 stars rounded up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pagan Restaurant	""|So happy to have found this place. Everything on their menu is outstanding! From appetizers to noodles to curries & desserts. We started with some chicken satays & tea leaf salad which were both really delicious. Then we had Roti palata with chicken curry which was my favorite among all the really good food we had. We tried the lamb curry", papaya salad (burmese style), rainbow salad, pan fry okra prawn, coconut curry noodles, catfish, salmon & lamb curries... none of which we did not enjoy at all! To top it all off, we had some delicious sweet mango with sticky rice & floating ice cream for dessert. Pagan is definitely the # 1 burmese restaurant on my list. ( I would've posted pictures but everybody just wanted to dig in so I didn't get a chance to take pictures. But next time I go, pictures will be taken forsure!)|Fun, offbeat and off the beaten path. The tofu is particularly good as is the coconut rice.|Must try the Tea Leaf Salad here .....The people here are really cordial and quick to bring the ordered dishes.I have tried the Nan Gyi Dok which was good as well. For those who like spice ..these were pleasing. Burmese and Thai in one place.|I had never had Burmese food and this was a pleasant first introduction. Me and my friend ordered something on the Burmese menu and something from the Thai menu. Both were delicious. Service was fair. The waiter there seemed stressed out but was able to help answer questions when I asked questions on the menu items.|Loving the place. We used to come often when we used to live in the neighborhood. They got updated menu too. Miss this spot.|Not experienced enough to know good Burmese food. Just judging by how good it tastes to me. Had the beef kebat. It was ok but inferior to basically any decent Chinese restaurant version of stir fried beef. Fine as a change of pace.|Funky little place with great Thai and Burmese food. My favorite lunch stop after a visit to the Palace of the Legion of Honor. Tea leaf salad is delicious. Tom Ka soup with prawns also very good. Mellow and interesting neighborhood with decent parking.|This Burmese/Thai restaurant is located right outside the entrance for the Legion of Honor and Lands End. After an adventurous exploration of Lands End, we were in the need for some lunch.PARKING + AMBIENCEStreet parking only, which was very difficult to find, we were circling the surrounding streets for about 10-15 minutes. It's a small place with decent amount of seating, mostly geared towards small parties. The decor is Burmese/Thai traditional and old fashioned with a conversational ambience between parties.FOODI ordered the Ong No Kaw Soi ($11) which is Coconut Chicken Noodle Soup. This was exactly what I was craving for and hit the spot. The noodles were well cooked and delicious. I also enjoyed the coconut flavor and creamy texture of the broth. The portions are also quite large, you won't be hungry after eating here. SERVICEDecent customer service and generally friendly staff. They were fast and had no problems with us splitting the bill on our cards. It was a 10 min wait for seating since it was a packed house.CONCLUSIONA decent Burmese/Thai restaurant in San Francisco at solid price. They have a large selection of items on their menu, I would recommend any noodle dishes. I really enjoyed the coconut chicken noodle soup, it satisfied my noodles cravings.|My mom doesn't really like Thai food because of a bad experience so I took a risk in coming here with my parents. But I'm glad I did!We came in on Saturday around 130 and it was still pretty packed, that's a good sign! We ordered tea leaf salad, papaya salad, curry beef, and a noodle dish. The tea lead salad had lots of flavor and a hint of spice which my parents and I really enjoyed. There are a ton of crispy garnishes like peanuts, garlic, etc that added to the texture and flavor really well. The burmese papaya salad was also very refreshing and delicious! My mom loved both salads very much! The curry beef was also cooked really well! Not overdone like most places, it still had some bite to it and had lots of flavor, goes really well with rice! I'll definitely be back and my mom doesn't dislike Thai/Burmese food anymore!!!|Just a short drive to the Legion of Honor from this restaurant...so grab a bite here first. This review is only for their Thai menu. We ordered their salt and pepper beef, eggplant stir fry and fried rice to share among two people. We finished it all. That good. We also had the roti drizzled in condensed milk. This we couldn't finish. But also that good. I wish I could remember prices but I'm pretty sure the bill only came out to $45. The restaurant decor is old fashioned and inspired by traditional Burmese/Thai history. Seating is cozy. And ample amounts of street parking!|I love Burmese food, so ended up exploring pagan. The best thing about the place is that the staff is very cordial and pleasing. The service was fast. Definitely do try NanGyiDok, I order this first time and ended up liking it. Tea leaf salad is pretty good too! it's a rare combination to have Burmese and Thai under one roof. So it has been a good experience.|Circled the block multiple times before rewarded by incredible karma. Thankfully, a tiny space opened up that truly tested my parallel parking skill. Tucked away in a sketchy block of Clement, Pagan is a little hole-in-the-wall Burmese eatery, the name not to be confused with paganism but named after an ancient city of Burma. There were no untoward signs of hipster pretentiousness; just a homey setting staffed by a couple of well-mannered, respectful kids. Don't expect any ambiance for there was none. The décor unsurprisingly was kitschy and minimalistic.Grab a table in Pagan and savor some of the finest in Burmese home-style cooking that have been oft neglected and under-appreciated. I am by no means a connoisseur of Burmese cuisine although not entirely a novice. So instead of starting with their iconic Tea Leaf Salad or Rainbow Salad, which I had before, we jumped right into their well-known curries and noodle dishes.Burmese Curry Prawns ($15.95) was the BOMB! I can't believe the dish I had today might even surpass Indian and Thai curries in terms of distinctiveness and deep complex flavors. It had just the right level of heat. The prawns were mid-sized, crunchy to the bite and cooked under precise timing. What then was their secret? I would say the obvious....the curry powder of course! Then the traditional blend of tomatoes, fresh chilies, garlic, onions, lemongrass and cilantro enhanced the tastes besides emanating an enticing aroma. In this sense, I love it better than Thai, which can be overwhelmingly sweet, lemon grassy and basil-y. (5/5)In an earlier review of an Indian restaurant, I mentioned it was rare to come across Egg Curry. I was delighted to find Burmese Style Egg Curry ($11.50) in Pagan's menu. Whoever thought of this recipe must be sheer genius as this was delicious, inexpensive and simple to make. The egg whites were lightly fried to blister and form an attractive golden crust.  The most notable difference with Prawn Curry was the judicious use of tamarind. The hint of sourness boosted my appetite.  I also particularly love okra and green beans that added some variety," fiber and crunch. The sourness from the tomato sauce and tamarind set off the second BOMB for the evening! (5/5)Burmese love their noodles. """"Kaw Soi Dok"""" ($11.00) is as Burmese as """"Lo Mein"""" is Chinese. Truth be told"," think """"kaw soi dok"""" as you would Chinese egg noodles that were tossed in a nutty and zesty sauce and served with an array of different contrasting condiments or toppings like fried crispy shallots", fried garlic chips and chopped cucumber pieces. Unlike Chinese stir-fries, Burmese noodles were tossed at room temp and so no wok hay expected! (3/5)Another simple form of noodles, See Jyet Kaukswer (Garlic Noodles) ($11.50) consisted of freshly cooked hot noodles tossed in garlic oil with a gentle touch of salt and pepper. Garlic lovers take note! The noodles were lip-smackingly garlicky and savory and you could add a protein for more substance and texture. Request to add roast duck with your noodles! I'm sure they would oblige. (3/5) It is always good to see a restaurant adding a new and lesser-known flavor to the cuisines of hard hitters like Chinese, Japanese and Thai in Inner Richmond. As with any sporting event, I always love to root for the underdog!|Always great fresh food and always great service. Love having this restaurant in my neighborhood.|Thanks fellow Yelpers for another great recommendation. I was looking for a place near the Legion of Honor for lunch before visiting the temporary #EarlyMonet exhibit. Pagan restaurant serves delicious Burmese food plus some Thai specialties.  The tea leaf salad was outstanding, even better than Burma Superstar.  There was a complex hint of spice in the dressing, absolutely loved it and would go out of my way to go back.  The samusas were also very good, the only choice was veggie.  The pad thai was solid but not note worthy.  I would recommend focussing on the Burmese choices. The staff is friendly and the location is easily accessed by Muni.  Great choice if you are in the area or need some grub after you get your Rodin on at the Legion of Honor.|Yes! I've been here a few times so far - for dine-in and take-out. The flavors are amazing and I can't wait to go back and try some new dishes.Dine-in: we had a party of 5 and we had to wait a little while before they could accommodate us since they have such a small, cute placeTake-out: called in, food was ready on time, pick-up was fast and easyDishes you'll definitely want to try:- Burmese Roti Palata- Tea Leaf Salad- Coconut chicken noodle soup- Fried garlic and pepper beef|Solid Burmese food at a decent (SF-adj) price. Pagan is a relatively small restaurant geared towards 2-4 person parties. On Saturday at 1pm we had about a 15 min wait for party of 2. I ordered the roti palata which is a fried dough flat bread with chicken curry and my friend got the ong no kaw soi which is a noodle dish with a coconut broth. Although my dish was called an appetizer the serving size was more than enough with flat bread reminiscent of Chinese scallion pancakes and an evenly spices chicken curry with potatoes. The curry is like a mix of Thai and Indian. My friends dish I found a little bland but the noodles were well cooked and the broth had a nice creamy texture.|The food is very, very good and reasonably priced. The menu has Thai food on one side and Burmese food on the other.  We've tried many and every dish has been delicious. The staff is friendly and efficient too. `Looks like they are the go-to take-out place as there is always a stream of people coming and going to pick up food, including us on numerous occasions.  Check this place out!|My husband and I were passing by to this place and thought of trying it out since we were hungry and looking for somewhere to eat. I would say it was a good choice. Their Burmese dish called spicy eggplant with dried shrimp was very flavorful. We also had Thai dish spicy chicken basil and tea leaf salad were good too. I recommend this place.|Food = Good but the problem is that many of the dishes tasted similar.  3.5 stars. Burmese Roti Palata (roti palata served with potato chicken curry) = good. Fairly filling for an appetizer item. $12.95x2.Burmese items: Green Papaya Salad (shredded green papaya, onion, gried garlic, ground shrimp, peanut & dressing) = okay. It was very sweet. Not what I expected. $11.50.Ong No Kaw Soi (coconut chicken noodle soup) = Good but one should eat this before eating anything else because it's not as heavy on spices as the rest of the food, so it'll be underwhelming in reverse (which was our mistake). $11.00.Shrimp Kebat (Stir fried shrimp with onions, tomatoes, green chillis and mint) = good. $15.95.Pan Fry Okra Prawn = good. $15.95Thai items:Happy Scallops (Scallops, chili paste, coconut milk, onion, bell pepper & basil) = okay. $17.95.Duck Curry (roasted duck, pineapple and tomatoes in red curry) = okay. $14.50.Coconut rice = good. $3.50x3. Entrees do Not come with rice.  (They offer other types of rice, too.)Thai iced tea = $3.00x3.Prices = moderate. Dinner for 6, including the 18% gratuity, came out to $169.33. Service = friendly and they try to be attentive. There's only two servers for the entire dining area, so beware of on-and-off lag times.Overall, I'll be back if I'm in the area but not a place I'll go out of my way to go to.|First off, you can choose from Burmese or Thai (or both) which is nice.  We personally had Burmese because we can get Thai food in lots of other places.We had the prawn biryani, which was solid (I must say that I have never had bad biryani but maybe I have not had it enough places) and chicken kebat, which was also very tasty.  It is a little spendy, but not overly so (about $15/item).The service was prompt and professional, if not overly friendly.Parking in this neighborhood can be hit-and-miss.  If you do not mind walking a few blocks, I would head West and South a bit -- you should be able to find something within a short walk.The acoustics are TERRIBLE.  It is not a very big restaurant and it was only half full.  My father wears hearing aids and he decided to take them out -- there was that much echo from the (limited) crowd.The bathroom is up several stairs.  I get around pretty easily but if anyone in your party is in a wheelchair," I would imagine it would be very difficult to access.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Regent Thai Restaurant	""|Yum!!! I love this Thai place! The dishes are so reasonably priced", you can get an entree under $10 which is so rare in San Francisco. And they're delicious! If you like spicy, get it Thai spicy because the mild level is not very spicy at all. When you eat in, they serve the rice in the shape of a heart, which is such a sweet food display in my opinion. I like their curries the most, both the red and yellow & gaang dang curries are delicious. I also liked their Tom Kha soup. I wasn't a huge fan of the Pad Broccoli, but that is the only dish I have had that I didn't like. Oh, and there are a ton of vegetarian options. A true neighborhood gem.|This is my go-to Thai restaurant in the neighborhood, and it never disappoints. Last week I had a favorite, Pad Kee Mao with Macaroni (corkscrew pasta) and shrimp. They have 2 versions, and I prefer the second, with egg & tomato. Both versions are good. Other favorites include their Tom Yum soup, green curry, and fish cakes. And yes, occasionally I treat myself to their fried banana with coconut ice cream. What I like: clean, good Thai food; friendly service; very reasonable pricing; and a comfortable place to watch the foot traffic on Church Street.|I've lived in Noe Valley for nearly ten years and this place is consistently great. I love the Golden Bags appetizer  - not only are they tasty but they are cute (can't help it). The Yellow Prawns on the Chef's Special menu are super flavorful and the light frying is perfectly done - I just wish they gave you a couple more. Recently tried the Tofu Choo Ros from the Chef's menu and it is also great - light crispy fried cubes of tofu with crispy mustard greens on top (maybe my favorite part). The Gai Regent was superb - the seasoning is similar to the Tofu Choo Ros but the double cooked chicken is so good we didn't even care - with crispy basil on top, as well. My boyfriend orders the Kao Pad Regent which is a Thai fried rice and I don't know why I'd never tried it in all these years, but I will be getting it EVERY time moving forward. The service is always good and it's super convenient to pick up for takeout. A great neighborhood restaurant.|This place is such a hidden gem in San Francisco!For one, the prices are absolutely reasonable compared to the rest of overpriced food and restaurants in the city.It's a very chill, relaxed vibe with calm music playing in the background. The staff is also quite attentive, albeit a bit aloof. The service was also quick. I came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. We all thought the food was amazing and authentic. They have a variety of menu options, and no matter what you order, you are bound to enjoy it.I forget which curry I ordered," but I ordered the """"mild"""" spicy - and that was too spicy for me. I might just be weak", but it made me wonder what their regular spicy must be like.I had a great time and I will definitely remember this place the next time I'm in the city and craving Thai food.|The highlight of Regent Thai is the prices. But on the other hand you get what you pay for which is kinda bland food. I've had the pad Thai, pad see ew, and yellow curry on multiple occasions and it was just okay. Not bad and not great. The younger waiter who's always there is also kind of snobby has a bad attitude. Regardless of the downfalls of Regent Thai, I'm going to continue coming here because it's super cheap.|Tried calling 20 times from two different phones to order food on a Sunday night. We got through once...and they out us on hold and never picked the phone back up. Not really sure how you order food from a restaurant that never answers their phone!|Great place with yummy plates If you likePad Thai and chicken curry, they are great !Fried rice are goodAnd you must try the jasmine tea|This place is super close to my house. So I went in around 6 when the place wasn't busy at all. I asked the guy that I need an order to go. He asked me to goto the counter where he will take my order. After waiting for 10 min he came in and took my order. My order came sooner than expected. I asked him if the paper bag have chili sauce in it. He said no. I asked him if I can get some. Without saying anything the guy went, came back with two chili sauce containers and slammed it on the table. And I was looking at him like what is going on. The place is not even busy. I wonder how do they treat their customers. Let's talk about food now. I ordered pad Thai. It was not good at all. Very dry noodles, it was only 4 small shrimps in it and wasn't good at all. I love any type of Thai food but it was the worst pad Thai I have ever had. And I'm not saying it because the gentleman treated me bad I'm saying it because it's the reality. If you love Thai food, I would highly recommended Marnee Thai. It's the best Thai place in Bay Area.|Regent Thai is a reflection of the quiet Noe Valley neighborhood it resides in. The ambiance is charming and relaxing, with a rose at each table and gentle music playing overhead.The wife and I came by for lunch and ordered four lunch specials to share:* Tom Kha Gai ($3.95): chicken coconut milk soup* Pad Thai ($7.25): stir fried rice stick noodles with egg, tofu, ground peanuts, bean sprouts, and choice of chicken or beef* Pad See Ew ($7.25): stir fried wide noodles with broccoli, egg, and a choice of chicken, beef or pork* Kao Pad ($7.25): fried rice with egg, tomatoes, onions, and a choice of chicken, beef or porkMost of the dishes have vegetarian options. We opted for the vegetarian versions of the Pad See Ew and Kao Pad. The Kao Pad was delicious and was my personal favorite, though I found that the vegetables could've been cooked a little longer. The Pad Thai and Tom Kha Gai were good as well. Unfortunately, the Pad See Ew was a bit too oily.When I asked for a substitution that I thought was reasonable (cashews in lieu of egg in a vegetarian dish), the waiter agreed to it but didn't tell me that he'd charge $1 extra. When I got the bill and asked about the extra charge, the waiter offered to remove it. Still, some communication upfront would've been nice.Overall, the quality and portions were reasonable. We managed to finish everything, but we left full. I wouldn't mind coming back again, especially for lunch special pricing!|This place is great! We live right around the corner and order take out all the time. They are quick, prices reasonable, and the flavors are amazing. I love the pad see ew, panang curry, their sweet and sour shrimp soup! Regent Thai does not disappoint!|Want authentic Thai food for an amazing price? Regent is the place!!! When I got my check and saw it was only $28 for 3 dishes and a drink, I was shocked. You start off with their complimentary fried chips (I think they're rice cakes?). My friend got a refreshing Thai tea and for our meal we split the Thai fresh egg rolls, yellow curry and pad Thai. I really enjoyed the fresh egg rolls. They were not fried. The rice cake was so fresh and the perfect texture. My friend wasn't a fan though, she was expecting something fried. The curry was the highlight of our night. The spices they used in that curry were perfectly balanced. We  woke up the next day wishing we could have it again for lunch! definitely order this. The brown rice was also shaped in a cute heart!Pad Thai was pretty standard but delicious!They had such great service as well. Everyone was so nice and the food came out quick!Definitely will be stopping by here again(:|If you're a Thai food aficionado as I, this place is going to fall short.  I belabored over 3 or 4 stars but went with the higher number because of a few things: menu with lots of interesting items you can't find in many other SF Thai restaurants, including the wonderful, but hard-to-find, Southern Thai dish Mussamun (or Massaman) Curry, and their prices for SF are pretty amazing for a place as this (being almost at the end of Church may be partially why; on the other hand, there are now several high-priced places in this area, so I give Regent full kudos for keeping things low), and a few more things I'll detail below.The main problem here is that the flavors are not bold enough -- the food preparation is somewhat lacking in passion & soul," so to speak.The Tom Kha Khai (chicken coconut soup) was just """"ok.""""Chicken Satay", although nicely presented, was otherwise uninspiring, with slightly greasy chicken and a fairly flavorless peanut sauce.The Massaman Curry, one of my all-time favorite dishes, Thai or otherwise, was truly lacking in flavor, the beef was a little tough, and it was missing the traditional burnt peanuts within.  But, again, I appreciate that they had it at all.Good things about this place, besides the aforementioned low prices, is a pleasant interior, very nice staff, albeit a bit harried, extremely quick order-to-arrival -- it's rare I've gotten my food so fast (eating in the restaurant) -- comfortable seating, and they serve rice chips with a sweet sauce as a free meal-starter, extremely rare for a Thai restaurant.But, unfortunately," this is not a """"destination"""" Thai restaurant", really only good for the folks who live in the neighborhood because it's so convenient.  In SF I still prefer House of Thai (in the TenderNob), Ploy II (Haight) and King's Thai Noodles (Clement) -- but, especially, my favorite in the entire Bay Area is R'noh Thai in Larkspur.  If you have wheels, definitely worth the trip!|This is our go to restaurant near our house. Food is delicious albeit on the small side but they also don't charge exorbitant prices like other Thai places. Service is good two. Our go to dishes Ginger Salmon, Thai spaghetti, and the chicken satay. Service good too... they offered my toddler free ice cream too!|The Gaeng Garee Gai #21 on the lunch menu, was delicious! The curry was flavorful and tasty, the brown rice went really well with it, and the cucumber salad was yummy as well.|You're so lucky if you live by this restaurant! This place seriously offers great service, beautiful dishes, flavorful and tasty dishes that are great price, clean and airy interior and bathroom. I highly recommend it and I will definitely be coming back!!!|I liked.  Flavors were there but my curry sauce dish had hardly any liquid, which made my rice not be able to be accompanied with any juice. I ordered two dishes that had Seafood combinations. My scallops were very rubbery and my calamari was chewy. The service was good. So no complaints there. I was kind of upset that I noticed they had wine once I was getting ready to leave. No one offered me a wine list nor was it on the regular menu. I might have been not so critiquing of my meal if I would have a glass of wine|The snapper is unique & delicious.  The pad Thai Is tasty.  The shrimp salad has unique veggies. Mint & basil.|Favorite Thai on the area! The soups are incredibles and the staff is super friendly. Buying food here has become a weekly need!|I was excited to try Regent Thai Restaurant as they had solid ratings on Yelp. However, I am disappointed to leave a three-star review for many different reasons. The biggest factor has to be the quality of the food. I cannot underscore how mediocre and bland the taste of the two dishes that I tried. The Boneless trout is overwhelming with monotonous sweetness. And the curried pumpkin with vegetables lacks dimensions. I could hardly taste any spices. The service staff was courteous, but they were rushing me at around 9:19 p.m. The restaurant was supposed to be close at 10. The dining room space is not adequately heated. I looked around and most of the customers were still wearing the jackets. I asked one of the wait staff and she explained that one time they forgot to turn off the heater when they closed down the restaurant. The next thing they knew the manager threatened to fire them. So as a result, they turned off the heater early. Overall, it was rather a disappointing experience. No way I am recommending this place to friends and family.|My friends and I LOVED this place. Every single dish was tasty as F, and the prices were super reasonable.We ordered a bunch of things, including the Miang Kham appetizer (an appetizer with dried shrimp, lime, ginger and toasted coconut - a bit bizarre but pretty good!), roasted duck salad, Pad Kee Mao, pumpkin curry," and more. All really good. The menu is huge and they have a bunch of vegetarian items as well.Definitely one of my top 5 favorite Thai restaurants in the city.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thep Phanom Thai Restaurant	""|What a gem of a restaurant", an intimate space great for first dates. the owner was so nice to accommodate a party I organized back In February and everything turned out perfectly. Thank you! Service was quick and the food was outstandingly rich in flavor, great presentation too!|There's only one thing I crave when it's cold out and that's the Tom Kha Gai soup at Thep Phanom. It's the best in the city, it's so comforting and delicious. Some other favorites are the Crying Tiger Salad, Green Curry, the Dancing Lady, and the Thep Thong. The staff is so friendly and welcoming. They also make good cocktails, like the lychee mojito. It's a great low-key spot to have good convo, listen to great covers, and enjoy delicious Thai food.|First things first: Groupons no longer accepted, restaurant.com certificates no longer accepted, that being said they do accept the yelp check in discount Atmosphere: very cute and comfortable, good for a first date or other romantic eventServers: attentive, professional and speedy Da Food: Portions on the smaller end considering that prices aren't that low and entrees don't come with rice. That is a huge pet peeve of mine. Rice is cheap.....it should come with your entree. Just saying. We had the Three's Company (prawns, scallops and squid in a coconut milk sauce) the flavor was interesting like coconut milk meets fish sauce meets lemongrass. We also had the honey duck which was alright. It felt like duck from a Chinese butcher shop on a bed of spinach and broccoli. The sauce I think I could have made at home using vinegar, soy sauce and honey. All in all in not super wowed. In total we spent $40 and left partially full and partially satisfied.|Tasty food, attractively presented, and reasonably priced. Highly recommend.|I've lived in the neighborhood for 12 years and this place is a great comfort food spot. Food is always solid, clean, fresh ingredients. Today I ordered the duck curry, wasn't greasy or too oily. Husband ordered a prawn dish. Prawns were cooked well, not over cooked like you'd get in many other places.  Always great here!|They are open on weekend morning/afternoons, but as a pop up thai noodle bar. Very nice people working here. Got the salmon noodle dish with a choice of type of noodle.|Oh my, this isn't the first time I've been here, not by a long shot. It actually may be the first Thai restaurant I had been to after I moved away from my parents' house for the final time. It was back in 1987, and I was a cherubic bean counter for a bank. A college friend of mine had told me his favorite restaurant was this place, so I went and have been coming back on an infrequent basis ever since. Obviously I hadn't been since 2006 because I never Yelped it before, which amazes me because I feel I know this converted Victorian spot so well. The staff is still as friendly as ever, so I took Jamie W. for his first time there. Sadly," it was as still as a tomb when we were there on a rainy Saturday afternoon.Bossa nova-style covers of Michael Jackson's hits were wafting from the muzak. Some worked like """"Human Nature"," others didn't like """"Beat It"""". We went for three hearty dishes. First up was the $15 Sam Kasatr", one of my favorite of their specialty dishes, a combination plate of sauteed chicken, beef and pork with sliced bamboo shoots and seasoned with Thai spices (photo: http://bit.ly/28NEYPy). It went really well with their $16 Pineapple Fried Rice, quite a delectable sweet-and-savory treat served in a grilled half-pineapple with fried rice blended with yellow curry and mixed with shrimp, chicken, cashew nuts, raisin, onion and fried egg (photo: http://bit.ly/28Rmjpp).I've had variations at other Southeast Asian restaurants, and this one was up there. Our last dish was the $12 Pad Se Ew with Chicken, a Thai classic with pan-fried noodles with fried egg and broccoli in a thick soy sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/28ONY9O). All the food reminded me that Thep Phanom is like my late mom. Yeah, I'd forget to call her. Sure, I didn't come home when I told her I would so she could do my laundry. But she would make me some nice dinner anyway, even though she hated to cook beyond heating up the Toshiba rice cooker. I guess I should come back here more often, Mom. But you should work on your health score. I mean 76, c'mon. No, Mom, I'm not being critical. Love ya...FOOD - 4 stars...familiar Thai dishes better than I rememberedAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...an old Victorian done up with some semi-kitschy Siamese decorSERVICE - 4.5 stars...still friendly as everTOTAL - 4 stars...sorry Mom...I mean Thep Phanom...I'll call more often|I used to love this place and used to come here all the time. When a Groupon for them came up I excitedly bought it but didn't have enough time to use it before it expired.The Groupon said I could always still use the value I bought the Groupon for though so I went in there to spend my $30 original dollars. No dice though," they refused to accept it even though I showed them the Groupon and the terms and conditions- they just pretended they had never seen it nor had ever offered that deal. Even though I showed them the picture on my phone. """"No! Never- maybe last year."""" (It expired in February.) Pretty ridiculous. Food is pretty good but slightly worse than Osha.|Food was good. Higher quality than many other Thai places in the area. Had the pad Thai", vegi spring rolls and Cashew chicken. All tasty! Loved the cilantro on the cashew chicken. The food was not greasy or over sugary (problems I have found at nearly Thai places). I'd eat here again!|It's been awhile since I have been to Thep Phanom but I remembered I enjoyed the restaurant and the food with a couple of my siblings. This past weekend I suggested this restaurant to a couple of friends who wanted to get together.  My gal friend loves Thai cuisine. Once we arrived she liked the intimacy and the decor of the place. When our other guy friend showed up we then ordered our food and the Frog Leap Sauvignon Blanc. Everyone very much enjoyed the dishes we shared: Basil Salmon, Pad Thai with Tofu and Thaitanic Beef spicy.  The food was delicious and the service was very pleasant.  It's a little off the beaten path in Lower Haight but worth the visit and most importantly my gal friend was happy I suggested to go here for dinner.  They do accept phone reservations.|Always very good.  been coming here for years.  Very Fun to bring out of town guests because their decor is beautiful and cozy and charming.   Definitely a long time favorite in this ever changing neighborhood.   I recommend the pineapple fried rice!   And any curry.   Also, try their fun non-alcoholic drinks.  Thanks Thep!!!|This was a main draw restaurant in this neighborhood when I first moved here 25 years ago. The menu was extensive, creative, and the service was exceptional.  BUT, things change.Went last night for a birthday dinner about 7-8PM. Only a few tables occupied. Appetizer menu was now heavy on deep fried stuff, and much of the wide variety of other dishes was reduced. Service was OK but not as friendly as prior visits. We were served an appetizer we did not order, and a main dish we DID order did not come. Soft drinks were big on ice; little on fluids.I did bring up the switched items with the bill, and we got an apology and a $5 credit (only good for 1 month!!), but the impression was already cast. There are lots of Thai places in SF. Look for a good one!|I love this place!!! So many unique thai dishes and absolutely delicious. We had the deep fried pumpkin (great presentation), fried pork, thep thong, pad thai shrimp, and tamarind fish. Everything was great but if I had to pick a favorite, definitely the tamarind fish...and the fried pumpkin...and the thep thong...nevermind I can't pick a favorite! And then the dessert! We had both the Kahlua creme brulee and the FBI (fried banana ice cream.) The Kahlua creme brulee is nice and light and the perfect amount of sweetness. The FBI was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with fresh fruit and ice cream to balance with fried banana. If you haven't been here yet, give it a try. You won't be disappointed!!|What a great place in Deboce Triangle.  Food is well made not over breaded and fried.  Good ingredients and friendly people.  Good wine choices.  Recommend for a good night with friends or a date|Love the look of this place, good food and great service! Try the dancing lady and Tom yum!|Sawadee kha!I came here a couple nights ago and I was super impressed. After living in Chiang Mai for 5 months, I got accustomed to the quality and authentic flavors of the cuisine. I've only had Thai food 4 times since being back for over a year for the fear of being let down and disappointed. But that didn't happen here! We order the spicy calamari (not something I'd usually order at a Thai restaurant)- but it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The sauce was tangy and spicy with hints of garlic. Just terrific.The Thaitanic beef was amazing as well. Little hint of yellow curry? Last but not least- the pad kee mao was kicking off with so many flavors," especially after adding some more spice to it. Pro tip: ask for """"prik nam pla"""" it's the fresh chilis cut up mixed with fish sauce. Goes great on everything.|Really liked this small corner restaurant! The free Chang beer with check-in is like.. the highlight and made us order more food to go with the beer :DCrying Tiger: 2-3 stars (small plate", $7)Not authentically tasting.. Good quality beef but they're missing the actual dipping sauce and roasted rice powder! South Sea (stir-fry seafood with eggplant): 4.5 stars (regular size, $14ish) Totally worth it! Hot stir-fry with lots of seafood, and really good seasoning! Tasted a bit Chinese rather than Thai though. Sprinkle lots of dried chili powder with it. YumzPapaya Salad: 3-4 stars (small plate, $6) Again, delicious, but missing the authenticity (needed a loooooot more spice and some crushed peanuts on top)Spicy Prawn: 2-4 stars (small plate, $7)This literally came with ONE prawn. :-( However, it was a really tasty prawn. Sauce was good too. Again, not spicy enough.You might be a little confused by my ratings here. Here's what I think.. This place serves awesome food, it's just not 'real' Thai food. But their service and everything made a really pleasant date night. I would still come back and hangout or try a couple more of their taps-sized dishes, which not a lot of restaurants do nowadays. And I encourage you to come try some dishes out and add a looooot of chili flakes on everything ^_^|ordered take out, which was on time and warm.  However the food was not spiced well for our tastes and portions were small.   Soup was the only dish that seemed flavorful enough.  we had not eaten here in a couple yeas but it has gone downhill since its hey days.|I have been here a couple times and always thought the food was good.  I saw a Groupon and decided to come back after many years.  My Groupon expired November 10 so I went on November 9 since I thought they would be busy.  They posted a sign saying no Groupons after October 31 and would not accept it.  As a small business owner myself this is just bad business.  We did nothing wrong and we're penalized because they did not meet their terms or have any flexibility.  The owners should be ashamed as I wasted time/money going there via uber. There are too many good Thai restaurants in the city and believe me I will tell all my friends to never go there.|What an amazing place to have across the street from our apartment!! The staff was so, so friendly and welcoming and really made our dinner experience as memorable as possible. Tan is such a sweet lady and Patrick is a very nice waiter. We shared all our dishes with brown and white rice on the side and had Chang beer to wash it down. Tan was so incredibly nice to bring us a complimentary mango sorbet with a raspberry and mint leaves on top, just because we are neighbors!! Such a great Thai dinner," we can't wait to go back! Would recommend every time!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sweet Lime Thai Cuisine	|We came here before a movie at AMC Kabuki on a Friday for dinner and enjoyed our meal.It wasn't very busy when we arrived at 6:00pm", but as the time went on, more and more people started trickling in... though didn't completely fill up the place. The staff was very attentive to our needs and constantly checked on us and filling our water glasses.Being gluten sensitive, I was appreciative that their menu had notes of what was gluten free and what they could make gf upon request.  I was pleasantly surprised that their chicken wings were gluten free too ( which I thought was good and had a good sweet/spicy sauce).I also got the pad nam prick pow, which was pretty good too. My only complaint was that some of the pieces of chicken in my dish seemed a little rubbery. However the food had some great flavors.I would probably come here again to try out the tom yum soup and a flat rice noodle dish (which is my go tos) to see how I really feel about this place.|Nice convenient location with very well made thaifood  offers Good vegetarian options and vegetarian chicken satayGood service and  atmosphere|Service here was very friendly and prompt!  I ordered the pad si-ew and my boyfriend ordered kao pad (fried rice).  We both enjoyed our meals and thought it was on-par with the Thai food we've had elsewhere in the US (but not as good as the meals we've had in Thailand). The star of the meal was the mango sticky rice (seasonal).  The dish was served with plenty of mango and the rice was still warm when it came to the table.  I think I ate it in silence for the first few minutes because I was really having a moment.|Great Thai food! I've been hunting for a new delivery place since my last favorite closed, and sweet lime wins the prize. Panang chicken and duck has really nice flavor and the meat is tender and delicious. The sweet lime Suki is spicy with a hint of sweet and acid for a balanced bite. The fried rolls are perfectly crispy. Yummm.|It was raining really hard when I was walking by this popular Thai spot in Lower Pac Heights close to J-Town. My umbrella had two of its spikes broken by aggressive gusts of wind, so I was already in a foul mood when I was getting drenched by a torrential downpour. So when I entered to grab a late dinner here, all I wanted was a little table where I could throw down my sorry excuse for an umbrella and have something comforting to eat. Fortunately there was a table open in a blind corner of the restaurant where I was certain I would be ignored. To the staff's credit, I wasn't. It must have been the inclement weather that led my desire to order some soup.The $13 Tom Kha with Chicken satisfied that need for the most part as it was a warm broth of coconut milk, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, lemongrass, and lime juice (photo: http://bit.ly/2ryJETB). The poultry was present and accounted for, but it was missing any seasoning or spicy kick that would have made it truly memorable. I needed something to chew on, so I ordered the $9 Fresh Roll which added avocado to the standard lettuce, mint, carrot, and cucumber in the rice paper wrapper and peanut sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2KTIiuS). Good and the avocado was a nice touch, but hell, it was time to reassemble my umbrella for that long, wet walk home.FOOD - 3 stars...good but not exceptional Thai fareAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...spacious with big pictures of limes (photo: http://bit.ly/2Kce84M)SERVICE - 3.5 stars...smilesTOTAL - 3 stars...not my favorite Thai place in town, wet or dry|Return lunch visit with my friends on July 27.  We have eaten here 4 or 5 times and never disappointed. This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Bay Area. We started with the Miang Kham app ( 7 ingredients) that you mix and create to your own taste. Try the calamari rings.  Man they are tasty, great flavor and chili sauce.  I could eat the entire plate. Got the Thai Spring roll for my son, which is a baby roll that kids will like, table shared pad thai, pad prik khing and noodles in green curry. Enjoy !|Great local little Thai restaurant. It's got wonderful large windows, so when I came on a summer Thursday evening ~7pm, the sun was streaming in nicely. This is one of those sit down restaurants where things are plated nicely. I ordered Pad kee mao. It was served up real quick and cooked on a super hot wok fire, which is the tastiest way to eat any kind of Asian stir fry. None of that lukewarm gas stove nonsense. Bonus points right there. The chicken bits and fat a*# noodles were delicious and chewy. Hot. Oily. With fresh Thai basil thrown in last minute. Mmm. This is where I'll go for a relatively affordable dinner when I'm getting feels for Thai food. I'll have to come back to try more. Give this place a shot!|We both had a great meal here. We were hungry. I got the vegan taro rolls to start. They were very good, practically greaseless and came to the table hot with a delicious dipping sauce. My wife got a lunch special with a tasty curry rice and chicken dish that came with a vegetarian fresh roll. I had the yellow curry with just vegetables and brown rice. The curry sauce itself was fantastic- completely full of warm flavors without being particularly spicy. Service was friendly and efficient. We witnessed a waitress deal with a customer in a wheelchair kindly and competently. The atmosphere is pleasant. The food was on the more expensive side but totally worth it.|Came here on a Tuesday and the place was pretty filled. I came because one of the yelp reviews had a pretty cheap menu. The menu on yelp was wrong, it's normal pricy Thai. I asked for my pad see ew  spicy but it wasn't spicy at all. Not sure if it was my taste buds but I like my Thai real spicy! I asked for more spices and they had lots to offer. The dish was very good a little on the smaller side in my opinion for Thai. Overall good place but I'll probably try something else next time.|Sweet Lime offers very good Thai food and we enjoyed our lunch for four. The ingredients are fresh and appetizers like grilled whole squid ($13) are expertly prepared and presented.While the cost of food keeps going up and Sweet Lime doesn't skimp on using quality vegetables (wood ear mushrooms) and delicious meats (the duck was a standout along with the grilled squid), I think their prices are a touch high, especially for lunch.Case in point was the green curry duck ($15) which was a smaller portion, a little bigger than a cup of soup, side Jasmine rice in a sweet heart shape and a simple salad.Every dish, though, was on point and the flavors were phenomenal including the dessert my little boy and his friend shared: fried banana ice cream with roasted coconut ($8).I had a micro bite of the coconut ice cream and it was complex and creamy, not too sweet. Two appetizers the boys had, Spicy Angel Wings, ($10), the calamari, a small papaya salad ($9) and the green curry duck with assorted drinks (teas, fresh limeade) plus dessert was $82.50 plus tip for the four of us.Service was attentive until the end of our meal then it fell apart: It took close to 10 minutes to get the check, the owner and server were fussing over a demanding couple who moved tables and seemed to have the kitchen in a stir.But after we paid the check and left, our kind server ran a half a block after us with a shopping bag we left behind. That was very thoughtful.A solid 4 stars, with a reservation about lunch pricing.|Was in a rush. They had just opened 5pm. Only ordered starters and Thai tea   They didn't means at all Service was amazing and friendly and food was delicious Can't wait to go back and try full meal|Ordered takeout 45 minutes before they closed and the yelp system scheduled it for the morning. I didn't notice that and showed up to get my takeout. The very kind people here whipped up my food in 5 minutes anyway! Extremely kind, very adaptable, and the tom khan and pad thai was tasty!|One of my patrons suggested I try this Thai restaurant and I absolutely adored the aura of the decor. The employees were polite, respectful and delicious. I tried a pineapple curry which I've never had before and it was like desert melting in my mouth. I enjoyed every bite and the full on experience.Highly recommended.|We have been to this Thai restaurant several times and it was very good. No. More than that. Bordering on excellent.  I hope this was just an off night, a different chef, something temporary. It was mediocre, lacking in flavor, bordering on boring. There were three of us.  We tried each other's dishes and it was blah all around.  One tip. Be careful to only order the brown rice you will eat, not a serving per person. We paid $9 for rice and only ate a little of it.  One serving would have been enough.  Disappointed in the food.  Excellent service though.|We stumbled upon this place for lunch today and it was a total success!! The prices were reasonable, the food was authentic, fresh and delicious. We had the spring rolls (highly recommend) avocado salad and pad see ew. They also have happy hour pretty much all day for inexpensive mimosas and beer. It is a family run restaurant and they make all of their own spices and sauces. Definitely check this out if you don't feel like waiting in line for Sweet Maple !|Not from the area, the aroma caught our senses from the day before. I am not a connoisseur of Thai food, but i know when something taste good. Food was delicious.|Kind of overpriced for what you get. The dishes are passable, though the ingredients weren't all that fresh. I was surprised that this establishment would survive in the City with many other Thai restaurants that offer much, much more.|Came here with friends and had a great time! Our reservation for 6 people was all laid out, and we were seated with no problem even though we were a little bit late. Would definitely come here again. Street parking was a bit hard to find, but park a few streets over and up, and walk over - there is definitely street parking if you look around a bit.|I'd say this place is like a 3.5 The food was OK - we got the general go-to's for anyone whose got trust issues with corner street Thai restaurants: pad thai and pad see ew. They were both pretty decent - not the best I've had nor the worst. But at the price? It was a bit over what I would have paid for that amount of food at that quality. Aside from that, service was generally attentive and we had a rather strange encounter with the owner of the restaurant who behaved like a quasi car-salesman type trying to get us to try out different things on the menu aside from what we ordered.|I love Thai food and though I've been wanting to try out this place that's really close to my church - I haven't done it for some reason. So on Good Friday - while waiting for the confession line to subside - I decided to finally go to Sweet Lime and try their food.I ordered the Pad Kee Mao (spicy basil pan fried wide noodles) and was blown away. I have tried so many different Thai restaurants in the city (and around the world) - I've even been to Bangkok a few times and a witness to how delicious authentic Thai food can be - but I still got impressed by this dish by Sweet Lime. It was well-seasoned, could taste that charred noodles and while the portion may not be as big as other places - I was still full after I finished it.One word of advice if you decided to come here : ask for the spice rack! One of the ladies there (whom I presume is the owner) told me to try the middle jar which has the fresh watery chili sauce. It was so tasty!!! It is hot - so watch out. But OMG I loved it! It was a little sour and tasted so fresh. I even asked her to start selling it in jars to take home - COZ I WANNA BUY SOME! :D She said she's working on it but doesn't know how to make it without preservatives coz they don't put preservatives in any of their stuff. Most things are made in-house with no MSG. So give it a try! I'm def coming back again to bring the hubster! :D,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vanida Thai Kitchen	""|We just saw this spot accidentally on our way to basketball training at St. Ignatius and wanted to eat a quick dinner after a long drive here. Glad we stopped by and ordered before reading other reviews! Actually decent prices and food was pretty good. We had the vegetarian eggrolls which were with the vermicelli noodles and shitake mushrooms which I like. It had taro in it as well but could not distinguish this- overall good. Pad Thai was the usual and good. Then we had the pumpkin curry and they use kombocha squash instead. I love kombocha but pumpkin would be even better", but understandable since not in season. So the dish was still good and mine was spicy enough that I liked it. Nice and clean. Service was friendly and quick. They were very attentive and filled our water cups. This will be one of my quick go-tos when I am in this area! I can't wait to try the other dishes ( my son only wanted Pad Thai but loved it all after eating it all) bc I saw other diners and they had the rad na( like chow fun) and angel wings which looked even better than what we had- Yum!|I've been here a few times for lunch now and I get the Thai fried rice with chicken every time! Although the rice is a tiny bit mushy sometimes, it tastes good overall.My girlfriend gets different dishes each time: red curry with rice, tom yum soup, garlic pork, etc. All of them were delicious!The restaurant is kind of small but there were tables open each time we came here. The staff is nice, service is good. I would recommend checking this place out if you're craving Thai food.One thing I wish this place served is fried chicken fried rice!Note: there is a lunch special menu available from 11:30am-3pm.|I would give this place a zero if I could for making my 3 year old cry. We have been loyal customers but the team who works Sunday nights is awful. They delivered our green curry to another table, set 2 dishes that we didn't order on our table. We told them they were not our dishes and the waitstaff left the dishes on our tableFor 5 minutes then decided to serve them to another table. That's not serve safe. Then our pineapple fried rice took 30 minutes to get to our table. We explicitly told them no prawns because of a shellfish allergy. They brought us prawns in our rice. All this and still no apology. Then said well do you want us to exchange it? IT HAD Shellfish which would make us die! By this point my 3 year old is crying because she's so hungry. They never gave use our rice and never apologized and didn't even try to make it right.|Pretty average Thai restaurant, close to Ocean beach. We came here mainly because it was a 15ish minute walk down the beach and we were hungry!! Ordered Thai tea (yum), Pad Thai, and Green curry with rice. Pad Thai was pretty good, nothing too impressive. Came with big prawns, I was pleasantly surprised by that. Big portion, a lot of noodles. Green curry was okay. Overall average Thai restaurant, convenient close to the beach, and good prices very affordable. Good service!|The place is clean and very inviting.  The food was hot, and the food was very tasty.   The portion was good to share with family.  I would come back again!  Even received a free dessert.|Nice neighborhood thai place with yelp check in for free thai ice tea that was really sweet and had to be watered down.  Service was friendly. Food was good and just hit the spot.|They serve the best thai food in the area during lunch time hands down! For the taste, quality, and price you cant beat it. Haven't been there for dinner but I plan on it soon.|Nice restaurant! We ordered the spices beef salad, red curry, sticky rice, and drunken noodles with chicken. Everything was priced really well. Most dishes were only $10. Will definitely come back to try the lunch specials.|This was an awesome place for a quick Thai craving. Star w friendly and food was flavored well|Food isn't great. Tried the chicken Pad Thai (usually my favorite dish from any Thai restaurant). It was bland and fishy, missing the real essence of good Pad Thai. Also tried the yellow curry, which you would think you can't really go wrong with," but this place really didn't taste good.|For $10 you get only this. Food is good but expect to get 2 portions (I'm 5'6"""" 130lbs) or down a bunch of starchy rice.|We got a lunch special with pad Thai", yellow curry, and rice. We also got angel wings. They were all super amazing. The pad thai had the perfect amount of tanginess and the perfect amount of ingredients. The yellow curry was yummy when mixed with the rice. It was kind of coconuty tasting. Very good and cheap deal for lunch special. The angel wings were crispy and tender. It includes wings and legs. We got free coconut ice cream with the check in. It was very yummy as well. The service was fast and friendly.|We've ordered togo before and its always good. This time, nearly everything was wrong.We ordered mild yellow chicken curry with extra potatoes and chicken with a larger serving of rice. What we got?They ran out of rice so we only got a small order, not a big issue. But when we got home, the curry was not the same. It was spicy, and still somehow bland. The last time it was rich and sweet. It also didn't come with any extra chicken or potatoes, instead they gave us a bunch of veggies (cabbage, carrots, broccoli, and some tofu). On top of that I found a hair in the food. So disappointing. Only reason for 2 stars is I understand sometimes these things happen, but it was so many issues and my husband cannot eat spicy food for health reasons so we had to toss it.|Pretty good thai food from what i tasted. I did a lunch special. They have 1or 2 item lunch specials. I chose the 2 items, eggplant chicken and yellow curry chicken. Their food is definitely worth the struggle of parking. Theirthai iced teas are nice and strong.  We will come back for sure.|MehOverpriced Overrated Petulant take out cashier Last ditch effort for late nite grub in outer sunsetSkip if possibleOtherwise prepare to spend thirty dollars for two entrees from a snobby cashier who gives no utensils and napkins for thirty dollars of food that should cost half as much|I've been here a few times before and liked this place but tonight was not a good experience. Short pour on wine, main course came while eating our starters so our entrees were cold when we got around to eating them. Under spiced and under flavored. Garlic pepper pork had no flavor of pepper or garlic, also hardly any cabbage. I wanted another glass of wine and was not given the chance to order one. We felt rushed. I don't think we will be back. Too many better options in SF...|I'm in town staying at a nearby motel. I ordered delivery over yelp. Food was delivered quicker than I expected. My order came wrong. I ordered the pad thai and asked for the prawns on the side, no peanuts and no  bean sprouts. The itemized ticket clearly says this. My meal was delivered with both peanuts and bean sprouts. The side of prawns came with 3 pieces.  And I also wrote I wanted many many extra sides of the Chile garlic sauce. They gave me 2. It was also delivered with no utensils!  I'm not ordering from here again.|GREAT THAI FOOD Hiidding spot that I got just by accident and this will be my Thai restaurant from now on...The food is EXCELENT !The service was very clean and on point...It was so nice I was able to leave  my doggy outside and They brought her watter....that was a very kind gesture from Them.|Garlic Pork! MmmMmmStaff has always been nice to me and seating area is always clean.|I've eaten in this place a few times, and the food was decent, so I thought it would be safe to order for delivery. I placed my order a few minutes after 5, and it arrived a few minutes before 6. The woman who took my order said delivery would take 25 minutes. Let's move on to the food. The green curry with chicken was at least medium spicy, but I ordered mild. I had to strain the solids from the too spicy liquid. Where was the curry flavor? The stir fried veggies consisted of mostly pale white cabbage, bean sprouts, and soggy fried tofu, not exactly the crisp stir fried green veggies I had imagined. But worst of all was the brown rice. Instead of visible grains of rice, I got what looked like a big glob of thick, mushy rice pudding. It's really sad that Vanida Thai would stoop so low as to serve me this crap. I flushed most of the food down the toilet where it belongs. Obviously, I won't be ordering from this place again," and I would advise you to stay away as well.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amphawa	""|This review is mostly for their ROTI WITH ICE CREAM. I've never heard of it nor tried and it easily became one of my favorite desserts and I'm pretty simple when it comes to desserts; more so on the less-sweet sorta spectrum. Here's my description on it: flat", flaky, buttery, croissant-like crust, with a slightly chewy dough, which couldn't have paired any better with ice-cream (I actually asked for the condensed milk on the side, I feel like that was a good call).  GAH, it was so good, and I'd visit SF again just for the Roti. I also hear there's so many variations to eating it. Ah, so much to learn about this delicious pancake!Ok! The food! I just discovered after reading other reviews that the dish I got was a super authentic Thai noodle, ya know the exclusive--which always turns to be those awesome dishes, and it was! I got (#94) Guai Jubb which is a pork themed noodle dish: pork broth (house special broth), pork entrails (innards), egg, crispy pork belly and square rolled up noodles! It was so yummy and fun to eat. My friend got a pretty simple dish, crispy pork belly stir fry with Chinese broccoli and side of rice--smelled AMAZING and tasted great. Would def recommend this casual place and would come again (mostly for roti). I can't stop thinking about it...|Most amazing THAI Restaurant in SF.Authentic dishes, in a very casual environment.Location is an issue, but after a day at the beach, is phenomenal-Every dish is spectacular -Must check it out - way out west on Geary St.|The food is good but my kids hate fishy smells so we don't frequent seafood restaurants or asian places (aside from Japanese and Indian). I dragged them here, and they had a hard time handling the scents in the restaurant. But ... They enjoyed their food (bbq meat and fried rice) and I did as well (eggplant dish). The Thai iced tea was good. The hibiscus tea was a bit strong, but not bad.I've been here a few times now and haven't had to wait for a table (lunch and dinner) and service is polite and efficient.|Nice place, Delicious foods, Excellent service. Come here with my friends for dinner. I will be back here again!!!|I had friends in from out of town and we brought a big group here because it was near my friend's house in the Richmond. The wait staff was very very attentive but also seemed slightly overwhelmed by our party of 10. The food we had was great! A few friends got various curries , pad Thai dishes, and I got Pad See Ew which was very very good. I especially liked the broccoli in it.  I want to come back to sample more of their menu!|If you have ever traveled west on Geary Blvd, in the Richmond district, you probably passed Amphawa a gazillion times... and not realized it.My go to place was Thai Time until we found several hairs in a dish...and than again. Funny how cleanliness is important to me.Well Amphawa is super clean and the food super tasty.Place gets pretty busy so the food is always hot and fresh.Curries are rich and flavorful and chocked full of meats and veggies.Noodle dishes are not too oily and have a great texture and flavor.Service is friendly and efficient.Solid choice for Thai food!|The salmon in banana leaf is SO GOOD! The pad see ew is amazing as well.  They are a small place but fast and delicious.  I always love coming here for great thai food|First time We dined here during the Day .. You'll appreciate this location more during the day...as its very easy to find..Its Conveniently Located on Geary and 19th Ave ..a Major Crossway to Golden Gate Park, Golden Gate Bridge, To Cliff House, To Union Square...Side from Reasonable Price..Id say...Food here is Really good...Been going to this place for 4 times in a month....Thats how good it is...Try Their Salmon (its wrapped on Banana Leaf) goes with Vinegar,Garlic,Chili and lime sauce...Add fried rice? you'll loved it...or the Curry Salmon ....Id be Adventurous to try other Dishes as compared to the Traditional Phad Thai (Which is good too).Come over and Try it ...|Unbelievable i could find this rigid Thai resto in SF !!!-reasonable price -all foods came with fresh ingredients -variety of Thai food It's called rigid from Thai ppl,so why don't go and taste the real Thai !!! Absolutely worth every single cent , u gotta eat there|I love this Thai restaurant! The staff is super-friendly, and the quality of the food is excellent. We customize our dishes every single time, including no added sauce, etc. My fave is the pra ram over brown rice with steamed bean sprouts side dish. You should definitely try it!|Everything I've ever ordered here has been flavorful. Definitely one of the better Thai spots in the Richmond District!A fan of the chicken satay, curries, and Pad See Ew!|Came here on a Friday night at around 7:30 PM and noticed that it was a bit crowded. My first impression was that the tables were somewhat too closed to one another, but its okay because my friend and I wanted to try out their Thai food. We sit down and we had to wait a while for the waitress to come stop by our table to take our order. It's disappointing to say the least because we were sitting literally next to the cash register and I'm pretty sure one of the waitress saw our glances. Nonetheless, the service was a bit lacking.We ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp and the Rad Na with Chicken (Noodles with the gravy sauce. Portions are definitely big, but there was quite a lot of oil in it. In addition, the Pad Thai had an odd aftertaste to it. Overall, we paid around $25 for the two dishes without tax. I think it would have been a more pleasant experience if the restaurant was also a bit more cleaner. They take credit cards and I noticed a lot of people did takeout. It's probably not the best idea to go here with more than 4 people when it's busy.|I had lunch here during my one hour break right after noon. It was my first time eating here and to be honest I did not even know this place existed. It was one of my co-workers the one who told me about it. We did not have much time so we ordered our food right away. We got a salad with mango, red onions, grated coconut and shrimp. We both liked it a lot and I am sure whenever I come back I'll be getting it again. The other entree was a dish with rice, beef, cucumbers and peanut sauce. In my opinion it was totally bland, and not even the powerful sauce was enough to make the dish more appealing. My co-worker was happy with it and he ate most of it. Anyway, I am happy I could tried this little restaurant, it's conveniently located and I am sure it won't take much time till I go back for more.|Easy spot for a bite. Not the greatest service but that's okay cause the food is delicious and reasonably priced for a big portion! Perk of this restaurant is their redone menu! Lots of photos and lots of variety in dishes!|*PLEASE NOTE* This place has a poor food safety rating. I did not know this when I visited -  but heads up to any unsuspecting Thai food lover out there! I came here on a Saturday night at 10:00pm. I called ahead at 9:50pm to see if we could make a reservation. The person on the phone was a little brisk, and firmly notified me that they close at 11pm, but that they had seating available. That didn't seem like a problem as we were super close by and really craving Thai food. However, I should have taken that phone call of a sign of the abysmal customer service we were about to receive. We arrived to a pretty much empty restaurant.. except for a group of 5-6 employees sitting down and eating. We were quickly shown to a table, and placed our orders. Menu was pretty diverse and they had a lot of different drinks at great prices. Our waitress was super curt, anxious, and honestly seemed like she wanted us to leave ASAP. I know the struggle of customer service but when your restaurant is an HOUR away from closing (again.. they close at 11pm) there really isn't an excuse. Food was OK. Certainly not worth the rave reviews on yelp. The Pad Kee Mao appeared almost white and the noodles were cut up really short, which was strange. She quickly brought us the bill at 10:30pm. As we were still finishing up our food and chatting, she returned at 10:35pm and pushed our bills closer to us (LOL). I honestly couldn't believe what was happening. We were out of the restaurant by 10:40pm.. a full 20 minutes before they closed! A word to management: If your employees are so eager to close the restaurant at 10pm.. by all means change your closing time to 10pm or hire different employees for the night shift.|Peanut sauce is #dank. King Vajiralongkorn would be proud of Amphawa.|I went to dinner tonight with 2 of my girlfriends.  I order LARP ($9.95) and a side order of rice ($2.00). My total was $11.95 with tax $12+. I told the lady my total with tip will be $15. The lady came back with the total of $15 and when I signed it without adding additional tip because the tip was already included she came back with the check telling me that I did not tip her. 1. That was totally rude of her. A tip is something that the person who is paying feels like giving and it is optional. 2. I tried to explain to her what had happened but she did not understand and still demanded that I tipped her again after each of my other two friends already tipped her 15% each. We usually go there for Thai food but the food tasted bland and to top it off service was horrible. It is safe to say we will NOT be returning.|Always impressed with the food! New selections are worth trying, like the baby back ribs and crab cakes. Great authentic Thai food.Love coming back here as always,Awesome job Amphawa!|This is probably the best authentic thai food you can get in SF that also comes with classic american favorites such as the crab fried rice. Having been to thailand 3x, I can tell you that the noodles here are legit AF. Try kao soi, pork shoulder and basically every other noodles.|3 stars for the food ONE star for the female with the short hair. Rude ass employee, holy shit. If you hate your job that bad why you here. Please PLEASE go somewhere else. Who is the MANAGER? Fix this damn person, they need help. Seriously, it's just sad seeing people so angry like that. Do us all a favor and stay your rude ass home please. I'm only here for the food cause it's great but the service, i always hope to come in when the rude ass lady isn't there, but she's always there. STAY HOMMMMEEE! If you're the manager of this restaurant, and you are reading this, you need to fix her act. Hire someone who is money hungry cause she clearly don't care to be there. **Oh and forgot to mention, when we paid cash and then card," she had the audacity with a rude ass voice """"is this just your tip?"""" Excuse me? Did we say this was your tip no we said """"CASH AND THEN THE REST ON THE CARD"""" we already have your tip ready for you", we weren't gonna walk out without leaving her rude ass something cause that's just not us but lord," this person needs a nap.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
